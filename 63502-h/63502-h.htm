<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
MWNTSEISON.
</h3>

<p>
Between two rugged hills, which rose abruptly
from the clear, green waters of Cardigan
Bay, the Gwendraeth, a noisy little river, found
its way from the moors above to the sands which
formed the entrance from the sea to the village
of Mwntseison.
</p>

<p>
In the narrow valley, or "cwm," through
which the fussy little streamlet ran, the whole
village lay.  It looked like nothing more than a
cluster of white shells left by the storm in a
chink of the rocks, the cottages being perched
in the most irregular confusion wherever
sufficient space could be found between the rocky
knolls for a house and garden.
</p>

<p>
The stream running through the centre of
the village was an object of interest and
attraction to the whole community, being the common
rendezvous for all sorts of domestic operations.
On its banks the household washing was carried
on, fires being lighted here and there, on which
the water was boiled in large brass pans.  There
was much chattering and laughter, varied
sometimes by hymn singing in chorus, so that
"washing day" at Mwntseison was a holiday rather
than a day of toil.
</p>

<p>
Here Nance Owen rinsed the laver-weeds[<a id="chap01fn1text"></a><a href="#chap01fn1">1</a>]
preparatory to boiling them down into that
questionable delicacy known as "laver-bread."
</p>

<p>
Here the sheep from the moors above were
washed once a year with much calling and
shouting and barking of dogs.  The barefooted boys
and girls paddled and sailed their boats in its
clear waters in the summer evenings; and here,
when the storms of winter made the little
harbour unsafe, the fishing-boats were hauled up
together; here, too, the nets were washed; and
here every day the willow baskets full of
vegetables were brought down to be rinsed before
they were flung into the boiling crock of water
and oatmeal, which hung from every chimney at
the hour of noon, vegetables being the chief
ingredients in the appetising "cawl" that spread
its aroma through the whole village.
</p>

<p>
A strong wooden bridge with an iron rail
spanned the narrow river, but was seldom used
except in winter, a few broad stepping-stones
making a more natural mode of communication
between the two sides of the valley.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing like a street in Mwntseison,
a rocky, stony road alone passing through
it down to the shore, in an independent sort of
way, as if disclaiming any connection with the
cottages following its course, and, where
possible, rather clinging to its sides.  Most of the
houses were straw thatched; a few had slated
roofs, and they looked awkward and bare in their
uncongenial attire.  The fierce storms, however,
which rushed up that narrow cwm in the winter
months soon softened any look of rawness which
clung to such an innovation as a slate roof!
</p>

<p>
At the end of the village nearest the sea, and
not far from the top of the cliff, stood a large,
wooden building, which seemed to attract much
of the energy and interest of the place, for in and
out of its wide-open doors there was always
somebody passing.  Within its boarded walls was
carried on the thriving business of sail-making,
which gave employment and comfort to almost
every household in the village.  Hard by, in a
cleft of the great hillside, stood the house of the
master, Hugh Morgan, "Mishteer," as he was
called, for he was the owner of more than half
of Mwntseison.
</p>

<p>
In Wales the landlord is still called "Master,"
and about the term hangs, in spite of modern
and radical suggestions, a flavour of the old
affection which once existed between landlord and
tenant.
</p>

<p>
There was nothing in the house to distinguish
it from the other cottages, except that it was a
little larger, and moreover boasted of a second
floor, over the two windows of which the brown
thatch curved its comfortable mantle.
</p>

<p>
Its front was well sheltered from the sea
wind by a bank of the cliff, covered with sea
pinks and yellow trefoil.  The sun shone full
upon its white-washed walls, and in the "cwrt,"
or front garden, grew two splendid bushes of
hydrangia, the pride of the village.
</p>

<p>
Inside, in the spacious old "pen-isha," or
living-room, the brown rafters hung low in the
dim light, for the window was small, and deeply
set in the thick walls.  The chimney was of the
old-fashioned sort, known as "lwfwr," and
encircled within its wattled sides a large portion of
the kitchen.  Under its shade there was room
for the small round table, the settle, and the cosy
bee-hive or lip chair.  Along the front of its
bulging brow ran a shelf, ranged upon which
stood various articles of pewter, copper, and
brass, glittering with all the brilliancy that
Madlen, the maid's, strong arm could give them.
She was proud of her long service under the
Mishteer, of the pre-eminence which he held over
the rest of the villagers; she was proud of her
well-scrubbed tables and chairs, and her
invariably clean and cheerful hearth; but above all
things, she was proud of that shelf with its
shining company of "household gods."  Indeed,
some of the articles ranged upon it would have
roused the enthusiasm of a modern collector of
curios.  The quaint, old brass bowl, with its
curious inscription, still faintly visible in spite of
Madlen's vigorous rubbing, a rugged old flagon
of pewter, bearing the same inscription, not to
speak of the quaintly-shaped copper pans, and a
regiment of tall, brass candlesticks.  When
questioned as to the manner in which he had become
possessed of such a goodly array, Hugh
Morgan was wont to say carelessly, "Oh!  I only
know they were my grandmother's, and I have
heard her say they were <i>her</i> grandmother's."  He
did not add, as he might have done, that
she had also told him that in long past days,
the eldest son of the family was always
christened from that bowl, for he rather despised
and disliked any allusion to the old tradition
afloat in the village that his forefathers belonged
to a different class from that in which he now
lived.
</p>

<p>
On the evening on which my story opens he
had just come home to his tea.  The big doors
of the sail-shed had been closed, the busy
workmen and women had separated and sauntered
away, for nobody hurried at Mwntseison.  There
was time for everything, and Ivor Parry&mdash;Hugh
Morgan's manager&mdash;had locked the door
and put the key in his pocket, with the comfortable
feeling, so unfamiliar to dwellers in towns,
that he not only had plenty of work to fill up
his time, but also plenty of time for his work.
He was tall and manly looking, ruddy featured
and blue-eyed, his broad forehead surmounted
by thick waves of light brown hair.  It was a
pleasant face to look upon, and one which
inspired confidence.
</p>

<p>
When as a boy of twelve he had entered upon
his work in the sail-shed, the Mishteer had been
his ideal of all that was manly and strong, and
he had constituted himself not only his willing
servant, but his almost constant personal attendant.
The Mishteer smiled at first, but gradually
learnt to value the lad's attachment; and, as the
years went on, they became fast friends, in spite
of the difference in their ages.  Although their
friendship was never marked by any condescension
in Hugh's manner, it was always felt by
Ivor to be a privilege as well as an honour, and
this feeling had grown with his growth, and
increased with every year of personal intercourse
with his employer.  Some such thoughts as these
filled his mind to-night as he traversed the bit of
green sward lying between the shed and the
Mishteer's house.
</p>

<p>
Having hung the key on its usual nail near
the door, he peeped round the brown painted
boards which divided the living-room from the
passage, and saw Hugh Morgan seated at his
tea.  He was well under the shadow of the large
open chimney, where a bright fire burned on the
stone hearth, although it was May; for here, in
the face of the north-west wind, the evenings
were often cold.
</p>

<p>
Madlen had drawn the round table for cosiness
near to the fire, in the glow of which the
tea-things and snowy cloth gleamed cheerfully,
while the little brown teapot kept company with
the bubbling kettle on the hearth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mishteer," said Ivor, putting his head
in, "I can remind Deio Pantgwyn to send the
waggon and horses to-morrow; I am going that
way."
</p>

<p>
"There's what I was thinking about," said
Hugh; "but I thought thou wert going to the
singing class to-night at Brynseion?"
</p>

<p>
"They must do without me to-night.  Owen
Jones is a good leader," replied Ivor.
</p>

<p>
"H'm, h'm!  I don't know," said Hugh
thoughtfully, "how he'll manage that change
of key in the new glee; but I must watch him.
Well, tell Deio to be here at eleven to-morrow,
for the sails for the Lapwing have to be on the
pier at Aberython by four in the afternoon."
</p>

<p>
"Right!" said Ivor laconically; "good-night."  And
away he went whistling, with his
hat pushed back, and his thumbs in the armholes
of his waistcoat.
</p>

<p>
The affection which he felt for his master was
shared by almost every man, woman, and child in
the village, where Hugh Morgan's influence had
spread itself, unconsciously to him, through every
household.  What special trait in his character
had roused this strong feeling it would be
difficult to say; but the Welsh are an impressionable
race, and doubtless the uprightness and firmness
of his moral principles, coupled with an unswerving
adherence to truth, had laid the foundation
of the power which he possessed over his neighbours.
He had also the reputation of being a
shrewd man of business, and it would have
caused a shock of astonishment to the villagers
had he committed a dishonourable action, or
miscalculated the result of a business transaction.  Their
attachment to him was not unmixed with a
certain amount of wholesome fear, perhaps to be
accounted for by the complete dependence of the
majority of them upon him for their daily bread.
He was a proof of the truth of the saying, "A
little leaven leaveneth the whole lump," for
Mwntseison was, outwardly at least, a pattern
village.  There was very little brawling or
drinking, considering that most of the younger
inhabitants were seafaring men.
</p>

<p>
Later in the evening, as Ivor Parry wended
his way towards Deio Pantgwyn's farm, his
cheerful whistle accompanied a train of busy
thought&mdash;pride in the consciousness that Hugh
Morgan confided in him entirely and made of
him a special friend, gratitude for the kindnesses
which he had heaped upon him, and pleased
satisfaction at the thought that he was of real
service to the Mishteer.  On the brow of the hill he
passed the gaunt and bare Methodist Chapel,
from the open doors of which came a stream of
music, the result of sixty or seventy young fresh
voices, blended into the delicious harmony of a
popular Welsh glee.
</p>

<p>
Ivor stopped to listen.  His voice, the richest
and most musical of the whole party, was much
missed in the gallery of the chapel, where the
singing class always met.  He longed to enter,
and take his usual place; but the pleasure of
serving Hugh Morgan outweighed this desire.
A smile flitted over his face as he listened
attentively to the female voices, which took one part
alone.  One voice soared above the others in
clearness and sweetness, and he took note of it
with a side jerk of his head.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys," he said; "I would know it
anywhere; yes, I would know it amongst the angels
in heaven!" and he turned down the stubby lane,
which led its meandering way through fields and
farmsteads to Pantgwyn, where Deio himself was
whittling a stick at the house door.  When
reminded of his promise to send the waggon and
pair of horses the next day to Hugh Morgan's
workshop, he answered in a grumbling,
dissatisfied voice:
</p>

<p>
"Three horses you ought to have; 'twill be a
heavy load for two."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit of it," said Ivor; "you may be
certain if three were required the Mishteer would
have them.  If you lived in our village you
would know that, Deio."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I have no doubt," answered the man,
in a sneering voice; "the King of Mwntseison is
always right!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, eleven o'clock is the time&mdash;will you be
there, or will you not?"
</p>

<p>
"I'll be there," said Deio, still whittling.
</p>

<p>
"Good-night!" said Ivor, turning away, and
receiving no answer from the grumpy man.
"Sulky old dog!" he soliloquised, as he retraced
his footsteps.
</p>

<p>
When he reached the chapel all was silent, the
doors were closed, and evidently the singing
class was over.  A look of disappointment came
over his face, to be quickly followed by one of
satisfaction, as he stooped to pick up a book,
evidently dropped by a member of the glee class
which had just dispersed.
</p>

<p>
It was a thin book with a paper cover, and
he recognised it as the collection of glees then
occupying the attention of the class.
</p>

<p>
"What good luck," he said, as he read the
name on the cover in his own handwriting, for
he had distributed the books himself.  "Gwladys
Price! that is lucky.  I must take it up to her
to-night," and putting it carelessly into his
pocket, he continued his whistling and his walk.
</p>

<p>
Before he had gone many steps, however,
he saw the owner of the book come round a turn
of the road, evidently in search of her lost
music&mdash;a girl of eighteen, slim, tall, and of unusual
beauty.  As she approached, Ivor was able to
note every charm and grace afresh, though they
were already indelibly stamped on his mind.  Her
wealth of brown hair, uncovered by hat or hood,
was gathered into a thick knot at the back of her
head; it was drawn straight away from the broad,
low brows, and on the head of a girl of shorter
stature would have looked heavy from its
thickness, but the graceful neck carried it with a
perfect and easy pose.  Her skin was of a pure white,
and almost transparent clearness, her cheeks of
the rich pink of the sea-shell; a pair of dark
brown eyes, shaded by their long lashes, looked
out rather seriously upon the world, though they
sometimes added a sparkling glance to the smile
on her expressive mouth; her full red lips
disclosed a row of perfect teeth.  In fact, Gwladys
Price was, without doubt, the possessor of great
beauty.
</p>

<p>
At the first glance she recognised Ivor, for&mdash;did
they not work under the same roof every day
of their lives except Sundays? and on those days
did they not meet regularly three times in
Brynseion Chapel?
</p>

<p>
"Aha, Gwladys, thou hast lost something I
see, for thou are hunting about."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;and thou hast found it, for I see it
kiwking[<a id="chap01fn2text"></a><a href="#chap01fn2">2</a>] out of thy pocket."
</p>

<p>
"Well voyr![<a id="chap01fn3text"></a><a href="#chap01fn3">3</a>] so it is; I was bringing it to
your house."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anwl! there's lucky I am to find it so
soon.  I missed it as soon as I had taken off
my hat.  Thee wasn't at the singing class
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;didst miss me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; Owen Jones' voice does not lead as
well as thine."
</p>

<p>
This was not exactly what he had hoped to
hear.
</p>

<p>
"Was the Mishteer there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, of course; we could not get on far
without him.  What a voice he has, Ivor!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I thought I could distinguish it, from
the road&mdash;and thine, Gwladys!  It was like a
thread of silk in a skein of wool!"
</p>

<p>
"Since when art thou a bard, Ivor?" she said,
with a merry laugh; "I won't know thee in that
guise!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I am not taken often in that way," he
said; "but some sights would make a bard of
anyone!" and he gazed with rapture at the deep,
brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
But Gwladys was proof against any implied
compliment, her simple guileless nature was slow
to take in any suggested admiration, more
especially from Ivor Parry, who she knew was
rather given to fun and banter.  She had grown
up so calmly and quietly, had budded into
womanhood so suddenly, as it seemed to Ivor, that
with a tender shrinking from disturbing the even
tenor of her life, born of true love, he had tried,
and successfully, to hide his passion from
everyone, more especially from the object of it.
</p>

<p>
And thus it was that hitherto she had not
guessed its existence, neither did she know that
she loved Ivor!  They had grown up together,
had paddled in the same stream, sung in the
same glee classes, and latterly, for several years,
had worked under the same employer.  Ivor had
long known that the happiness of his life was
bound up in her, while she was only just
awaking to the feeling that the boy who, being seven
years her elder, had always constituted himself
her protector, had grown into the man whom
of all the world she was most desirous of pleasing.
</p>

<p>
During this digression she had thoughtfully
inspected her glee book.
</p>

<p>
"There's a beautiful glee we are learning
now, isn't it? only 'tis pity the words are
English!  There's hard to say, 'Whosse rocey
fingares ope the gates of day.'"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis hard at first," he answered.
</p>

<p>
A silence fell on them as they approached the
village together.  Ivor was filled with varied
feelings: pleasure at thus having Gwladys all to
himself, anxiety lest another should rush in where he
feared to tread, and above all, the difficulty of
keeping his feelings under proper control in her
presence.  "Only eighteen," he thought.  "I
will wait till she is twenty; but meanwhile I will
try to win her love."
</p>

<p>
Oh, blind and foolish Ivor! and no less blind
Gwladys! who stood upon the brink of that
awakening which should let in a flood of light
and happiness upon her life.  Both seemed to
shrink from drawing aside the curtain which hid
the future from their sight; for was it not
sufficient happiness thus to meet every day, and
almost every hour of the day?  Was it not enough
for Gwladys to raise her eyes from her work on
the rough sail-cloth, and see his stalwart form
moving about amongst the bales and cordage,
and often to find his clear, blue eyes fixed upon
her!  A word or a smile from him would raise
a flush to her face, and caused a tumultuous
flutter under the pink muslin 'kerchief crossed in
soft folds over her bosom.  She knew it was
pleasant to be near him; but that he found the
same delight in her presence was beyond the
range of her imagination, for was he not her
master in one sense, being Hugh Morgan's manager,
who trusted him entirely, and made no secret of
his intention to take him into partnership?
</p>

<p>
As they reached her mother's door, she hesitated
to ask him in; but he settled the matter by
raising the thumb latch, and preceding her into
the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Nani," he said; "here is your daughter,
whom I found straying about the roads,
peering about like a chicken seeking for grain!"
</p>

<p>
As he spoke, a woman rose from a low oak
stool by the fire with a pleasant smile of welcome.
She was pale and delicate-looking, but still bore
traces of the beauty which had once been hers.
</p>

<p>
"Wel! wel!  Ivor Parry! it is you, indeed,
who are so kind as to bring me back the truant?
Many thanks to you.  She rushed away like a
wild thing, and I guessed she had lost her glee
book.  And how are Lallo and Gwen?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed, and in good spirits.  You
have heard the news, of course!  No?  Gwen is
going to be married next week.  Siencyn Owen
and she have been long enough making up their
minds, haven't they?"
</p>

<p>
"So soon!" answered Nani.  "Wel! that will
be a grand thing for Lallo!"
</p>

<p>
"Would you be so willing to part with
Gwladys, then?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed; that would be quite different;
but Lallo! why, I don't think there has ever been
such a thing as a wedding in her family before!
Wel, not for three generations whatever!"
</p>

<p>
"No, I suppose not; but Gwen thinks a new
name will be better than the old one.  After the
bidding she will sail away with Siencyn in the
Speedwell."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad," said Nani; "and you will be
glad, Ivor!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the young man thoughtfully, "I
will not be sorry, although I have been very
happy with Lallo and Gwen.  I am going to
Mary the Mill's to-morrow.  Wel!  I must go
now.  Nos da, Nani; nos da, Gwladys."
</p>

<p>
The girl was standing beside the little window
looking over the sea, her brown eyes fixed on
the ripples of gold and crimson that stretched
away to the west.  She pointed with her finger
to the sinking sun as she answered:
</p>

<p>
"Nos da.  I was just thinking <i>there</i> was
something to make a bard of thee."
</p>

<p>
Ivor saw that she had not understood his
former compliment, so would not venture upon
another, and merely saying, "'Tis a promise of
fine weather," left the cottage.
</p>

<p>
"Come, dear heart," said Nani, "thee'lt want
thy supper after all thy singing!  How did it go
to-night?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, pretty well, mother!" and as she sat
down to the shining oak table she hummed to
herself the English words which had puzzled
her:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Who teeps the hills with gold,<br />
  Whosse rocey fingares ope the gates of day."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"What gibberish is that?" said the gentle-faced
mother.  "Now, don't thee get too proud
to speak Welsh!  And Gwen is going to be
married so soon!"
</p>

<p>
"Ivor seems glad, mother."
</p>

<p>
"And no wonder!  When a lass shows her
love too plainly, a sensible man draws back."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys did not answer for some time, till
her mother spoke again.
</p>

<p>
"Didst think Ivor Parry would ever have
taken a fancy to Gwen?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother, no! never such a thing came
to my thoughts!  Ivor Parry! no, no, he never
thinks of such things!"
</p>

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When Ivor reached his own lodgings he
found Gwen had brought her work out of the
cwrt[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] to catch the last beams of the evening sun.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" he said pleasantly, "getting on with
the laces and ribbons?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," she said, with a toss of her head;
"I am not one to let the grass grow under my
feet when once I have made up my mind."
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, you never were," and he disappeared
under the low doorway, where his voice
could be heard in cheerful conversation with
Lallo.
</p>

<p>
There had been nothing unfriendly in Gwen's
words, but Ivor was quite aware of the spiteful,
sweeping glance which she cast after him.
</p>

<p>
When she soon after followed him into the
dark penisha,[<a id="chap02fn2text"></a><a href="#chap02fn2">2</a>] she flung her work aside, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Wfft to the old sun; he went down just as
I wanted him."
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, he'll come round again
to-morrow," said Lallo, "and thou canst catch his
first beams if thou wishest."
</p>

<p>
Gwen made no answer, but raked the embers
together with her wooden shoe.  She was a pale,
freckled girl, with a short nose and a wide mouth,
and had no pretensions to beauty; but her
shrewdness and quickness of repartee had made
her a favourite with the lads of the village.
</p>

<p>
Siencyn Owen had courted her for years, had
been flattered and rebuffed in turns, and had
remained faithful through all; while Gwen, who
had nursed a secret passion for Ivor, had in vain
made every endeavour to win his affections.  At
length her shrewdness had made it evident to her
that she was wasting her youth and her blandishments
in a hopeless cause, and she had accepted
the long-enduring Siencyn, although in that
passionate, fiery little heart of hers, Ivor Parry still
had the first place.
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said, examining the brass tips of
her clocs,[<a id="chap02fn3text"></a><a href="#chap02fn3">3</a>] "what did Gwladys say about the
news?"
</p>

<p>
He was startled at the suddenness of the
question, but knew better from experience than
to try to parry Gwen's thrusts.
</p>

<p>
"She was very glad," he said, "and so was
Nani&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose so!  And was she glad to get
her glee book?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed!" said Ivor, rising and standing
in the doorway, a black figure against the
crimson sky.  "Little witch!" he said to himself,
"I wonder how she knew; but what doesn't she
know!  They said her grandmother was a witch,
and her ways have descended to her granddaughter,
I think."
</p>

<p>
As a fact, Gwen, returning through the fields
from the singing class, had seen him stoop to
pick up the book.  Ivor was not absolutely free
from superstition; what dweller on that rocky
coast is?  With his hands thrust deep in his
pockets, he sauntered down the road to learn
what tidings 'n'wncwl[<a id="chap02fn4text"></a><a href="#chap02fn4">4</a>] Jos (the general
newsmonger of the village) had of the Skylark which
should have arrived with the morning's tide.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Gwen had carried her bit of work
to the penucha[<a id="chap02fn5text"></a><a href="#chap02fn5">5</a>] and had locked it up in the
shining, black "coffor," which contained the
wardrobe of the family.  She saw her mother pass the
window, carrying her red pitcher to the well, and
knowing she was alone in the house, sat down in
front of the fire and gave the rein to her thoughts,
and even spoke them aloud.
</p>

<p>
"She was very glad, no doubt, and they rejoiced
together!  Oh, yes, Ivor, I have guessed
your secret long ago, and if she were not such a
fool, such a simple baby, she would have seen
it, too; but she doesn't, that's one comfort!
Llances![<a id="chap02fn6text"></a><a href="#chap02fn6">6</a>]  But never mind, it wasn't for nothing
that I lived with my grandmother.  No, it wasn't
for nothing that I sat with her night after night
over the peat fire!  I found out much from her,"
and rising, she stamped her foot and clenched her
hand, and an evil look came into the eyes which
looked so cunningly under those half-closed lids.
</p>

<p>
"I hate her!" she said; "and granny has told
me that if you have reason to hate anyone you
can work them harm without going near them
or touching them!  And haven't I reason?  'You
can keep your mind,' she said, 'so constantly
fixed upon that one wish that your enemy will
not prosper.'  Wel, indeed! perhaps that is
nonsense!  I will marry Siencyn Owen&mdash;poor lad,
he is faithful and true, and I will make him a
good wife&mdash;but 'tis Gwladys I will often be
thinking about!"
</p>

<p>
She paused a moment, and approached the
little window, through which the glow of the
setting sun lighted up her face; it was not
pleasant to look upon.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, happy thoughts!" she said, with a
sneering smile.  "Granny!" she cried, turning
back to the gloom of the little room, and raising
her hand above her head.  "Granny, granny!  I
wish you were here to help me! and, who knows,
perhaps you are!  There was no love lost
between you and Nani Price!"
</p>

<p>
Almost as she spoke the last words Ivor
Parry returned.
</p>

<p>
"I am as hungry as a hound," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Supper then directly; and here comes
mother," she said.
</p>

<p>
And as the three sat at their supper of
barley bread and fresh butter, with the addition,
of course, of a bowl of cawl,[<a id="chap02fn7text"></a><a href="#chap02fn7">7</a>] no one who looked
in through that little window would have guessed
that such stormy passions had, a few minutes
ago, filled the heart of one of the party.
</p>

<p>
Next day the large doors of the sailmaker's
shed stood wide open, letting in a flood of
sunshine and a refreshing breeze, which bore on its
wings the scent of the seaweed lying strewn on
the shore below.  Inside the air was full of merry
talk and laughter, while the call of the seagulls
and the plash of the waves on the shore came in
with the wind.  The Mishteer was busily engaged
with his foreman arranging the sails which had
been ordered from Aberython, occasionally
going to the doorway to look up the hill for the
waggon which was to carry them away.
</p>

<p>
He was about forty years of age, broad-shouldered
and firmly built, his head, covered with
closely curling jet black hair, was perfect in pose
and shape; exposure to all weathers had browned
a naturally dark skin.  His black beard and
moustache were trimly and carefully kept.  His
teeth were unusually white and even, the eyes
which he was shading from the glare of the
morning sun were black as night, but had in
their depths such a bright sparkle, that they
suggested the idea of black diamonds.  His open
shirt and upturned sleeves disclosed a brawny
chest and muscular arms.  Everything about him
betokened firmness and strength; and as he
turned round to address his workmen, his voice,
though pleasant, and even musical, made itself
heard clearly above the loud talking and laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Here, somebody!" and instantly there was
a hush in the hubbub, while two or three men
and women came forward to show their alacrity.
"That knot of boys down the valley!  I believe
they are ill-treating some helpless creature in the
stream!"
</p>

<p>
Before he had finished his orders, one of the
workmen had clapped his hat on, and, running
down to the river, was soon dispersing the little
crowd of evil-doers.
</p>

<p>
"The Mishteer has seen you!" was all he
said; but this was quite enough to make the
dirty little brown hands loosen their hold on the
stones, and the sun-burnt heads droop with
shame, while they stared with round, repentant
eyes at the half-drowned dog which they had
been pelting with stones, and which the
messenger was carrying gently away.
</p>

<p>
"Another lucky dog like myself!" mused
Will, as his long strides carried him up the bank
to the sail-shed.
</p>

<p>
"Who were the boys?" asked Hugh Morgan,
looking down at the frightened, shivering
dog.  "Ah, Sh√¢n Pentraeth's!  Well, none of
you boys are to play with them for a week; d'ye
hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Or goren,[<a id="chap02fn8text"></a><a href="#chap02fn8">8</a>] Mishteer," came in answer from
ten or a dozen boys working together at one end
of the shed.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Morgan having made a bed for the dog
on a coil of ropes, turned once more to the
doorway as Deio Pantgwyn appeared leading a horse
and cart.
</p>

<p>
"Where's your waggon and two horses?"
asked the Mishteer, with a darkening look on his
face, which his work-people all knew betokened a
storm.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, Mishteer, Cymro hurt his leg last
night, and he was limping this morning, so I
could not bring him; but it's all right, Flower
can easily take the load herself."
</p>

<p>
"Stop, Deio; didn't you tell Ivor Parry last
night that we ought to have three horses? and
now you want one to take the load!  Go home
again, and learn that no one who works for me
shall be cruel to any animal&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But I thought the sails must be on the quay
to-day?"
</p>

<p>
"So they ought; and you will put me to
great expense, and Captain Morris to great
inconvenience; but that horse shall not carry that
load&mdash;so off you go!"
</p>

<p>
Deio stormed and swore; but the Mishteer
was inexorable, and, turning to Ivor, said:
</p>

<p>
"Leave everything as it is until the full moon
tide, and I will go myself to-night to explain to
Captain Morris&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Will I borrow another horse to harness with
Flower?" Deio shouted from outside, "since you
think so much more of a horse than of a man's
time and trouble."
</p>

<p>
"It would be too late now, and I shall not
want you again."
</p>

<p>
Deio turned his horse and cart away, and the
little incident seemed to pass out of Hugh
Morgan's mind, for he turned his attention to some
other section of his work with apparent
equanimity.
</p>

<p>
"I have been thinking lately, Ivor, that we
ought to have one of those machines for rolling
up and holding the work in place for the women.
See Gwladys Price now, how she has to drag at
that sail to sew on the reef points."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Ivor, "it would lighten the work
very much, no doubt; but it does not seem to
weigh very much on her strength or spirits just
at present, does it?" and the two men looked
over to where a knot of girls were listening with
evident amusement to 'n'wncwl Jos, who, on the
strength of the fact that he took in a weekly
newspaper, constituted himself the general
dispenser of news.
</p>

<p>
Every day he made his appearance in the
sail-shed brimful of information, and should the
newspapers be wanting in anything interesting,
he did not hesitate to invent new or garnish up
old tales from the store of his memory.
</p>

<p>
In personal appearance he resembled a bundle
of knobs; in fact, had not a wooden leg
somewhat broken the circular outline, he would have
looked like a big knob himself.  His head was
certainly like a black knob, and his face, the
colour of new polished mahogany, was made up
of shining knobs, his nose being round and
smooth, his cheeks the same, especially one
which always held a large quid of tobacco, and
his fat, brown fists were like two more knobs.
</p>

<p>
One of his eyes was always closed as if in a
chronic wink, while the other was unusually wide
open.  It was an undecided question in the
village whether the closed eyelid covered an eye or
not.  As a matter of fact, it did not, for he had
lost it when quite a young man, and it was the
account of this event which was now exciting the
laughter of the women gathered around him.
</p>

<p>
"Come, let us have a share of the fun," said
Hugh Morgan, approaching, his eyes fixed
smilingly on Gwladys Price's laughing face.  She
held her sides, and threw her head back in a fit
of laughter, her dimpled face and white teeth
looking very charming in their abandon of mirth.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dear, dear! its 'n'wncwl Jos!  Oh, dyr
anwl, I have laughed till my sides ache."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there's a girl she is to laugh," said
'n'wncwl Jos, putting in the stops with his
wooden leg, "in spite of those serious brown eyes of
hers.  Hegh, hegh, hegh!  I'll back her for a
good laugh against any other girl in
Mwntseison."  (Stump, stump.)  "I was only telling her
how I lost my eye long ago, and that's how she
takes it!  Hegh, hegh! true as I am here.  I
was in the Bay of Loango, out there in Africa,
me sitting on the edge of the ship, The Queen of
the South, Captain Lucas, and whew! back I
went among the sharks.  In a moment an old
ghost of a fellow darted after me.  'Here I'm
going,' says I to myself, 'safe to Davey Jones'
locker, and in a nasty conveyance, too!'  (There
she is laughing again, look!)  The shark stopped
a minute just to take a good look at me, when
what should I feel but a sharp hook in my eye.
I knew at once 'twas the rope and the hook from
the ship, and Diwedd anwl![<a id="chap02fn9text"></a><a href="#chap02fn9">9</a>]  I'd rather have
forty hooks in my eye than be swallowed by that
old white ghost.  I was reaching the sandy
bottom just as the hook caught me, and partly with
the pain, and partly with joy, I danced and
floundered about ('twas before I lost my leg) and
kicked up such a shindy, that I made a thick
cloud of sand about me, and the old shark backed
a bit, and I tugged the rope, and they pulled
me up."
</p>

<p>
"By the hook in thine eye?" asked Gwen
sarcastically, for 'n'wncwl Jos's stories were
always taken <i>cum grano salis</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Diwedd anwl!  No!  I took that out pretty
sharp&mdash;hegh! hegh! hegh!&mdash;and fastened it in
the band of my trousses.  'Fforwel, old boy!'
sez I, with my thumb to my nose, though I was
nearly losing my breath; and as true as I'm here,
the old fellow was offended"&mdash;(stump,
stump)&mdash;"hegh! hegh! hegh!&mdash;for he made a spring at
me, and snapped at my leg, just as they were
pulling me out of the water.  If it wasn't for my
trousses he'd have had her off!  I have thanked
the Lord hundred thousand times for those good,
strong trousses, so glad I am that the old fellow
didn't have the pleasure of his dinner from me!
not so much for the worth of the leg (for she
often gave me trouble with rheumatics&mdash;hegh! hegh!&mdash;and
she does now, though she's buried
safe in Glasgow!  True as I'm here she does!),
but to spite the old shark!  'Not for the worth
of the loaf,' as the woman said, 'but for the
roguery of the baker!'&mdash;hegh! hegh! hegh!"
(Stump, stump, stump.)
</p>

<p>
"Keep the rest till to-night, 'n'wncwl Jos,"
said Hugh Morgan, joining in the laugh which
followed the story; "I'm coming in to have a
pipe with you.  How is Mari?"
</p>

<p>
"Mari!" said the old man, with a strangely
softened look on his sunburnt, shining face.
"Mari! oh, she's very well, calon f√¢chl[<a id="chap02fn10text"></a><a href="#chap02fn10">10</a>] she is
well, indeed; though, now I remember, she had
a headache&mdash;there's a brute I am to forget!" and
off he stumped in great haste to make up for his
forgetfulness.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys dried her tears of laughter, and applied
herself with renewed attention to the huge
sail, of which she held one corner, while Gwen
sewed at the other.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis heavy for thee, lass," said Hugh Morgan,
drawing near, and rolling a log under the
corner which Gwladys was working at.
</p>

<p>
The girl smiled, but looked a little
embarrassed by the Mishteer's kindness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no! no heavier than Gwen's corner,
Mishteer, and I am quite as strong."
</p>

<p>
It was said innocently, and Hugh knew it
was; but a deep flush overspread his face as he
turned to the other girl, and offered her the
same help.
</p>

<p>
"The same log will do for both," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no need," said Gwen, with a slight sneer
in her voice, as much as she dared show the
Mishteer; "of course this corner is lighter than
the other."
</p>

<p>
As Hugh passed on to another set of workers,
she looked after him with a slowly dawning
perception in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"He is very kind to thee," she said, looking
at Gwladys under her half-closed lids; "what has
come over him?"
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed, he is always kind, isn't he?
even to his dogs.  See how that little
half-drowned dog wags his tail when he passes."
</p>

<p>
Gwen did not answer; but as her companion
proceeded with her work she looked at her furtively
from time to time with hatred and jealousy
in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
The afternoon found them again at their
work.  Gwen had had time, while she drank her
cawl and ate her barley bread at dinner, to
arrange her ideas.
</p>

<p>
"Art coming to my wedding on Monday?"
she asked carelessly.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anwl, of course!  Thee'st asked me
and mother, and we are coming."
</p>

<p>
"Madlen is to be my bridesmaid, and Ivor
Parry will be the teilwr.[<a id="chap02fn11text"></a><a href="#chap02fn11">11</a>]  Who shall I find for
thee?  Dye Pentraeth?  I have heard thee art
fond of him!"
</p>

<p>
"Dye Pentraeth?" said Gwladys, with perfect
composure.  "Wel, indeed! he will do very
well for me; I will get on all right with him; but
I don't think thou hast ever heard I am fond of
him, Gwen; thee hast made a mistake."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, indeed!" said Gwen, with a yawn.
"Was it Ivor Parry, perhaps?  I didn't take
much notice."
</p>

<p>
Now, indeed, Gwladys was moved, and Gwen
watched her mercilessly as a crimson flush
overspread cheeks, forehead, and neck.
</p>

<p>
"They were right, too, I see," she said, in a
sarcastic tone.  "Wel, wel, merch i, 'tis to be
hoped he will be pleased when I tell him."
</p>

<p>
"They were <i>wrong</i>!" said Gwladys, covering
her face with both hands for a moment; and
then, standing up, she indignantly threw the
corner of the sail away from her.  "Thee hast
insulted me enough!  To say I loved a man who
did not love me!  Wel wyr!" and her fiery
Welsh blood surged through her veins, her
bosom heaved, and her eyes flashed, and Gwen
was satisfied.
</p>

<p>
"Twt, twt," she said, "there's no need for a
beacon fire!  I wasn't thinking what I said&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wilt tell him such a thing?" said Gwladys;
"if thee dost, I will tell the Mishteer!"
</p>

<p>
"Not I!" said Gwen; "I have other things
to think about."  And sitting down to her work
again, Gwladys' quick temper subsided as suddenly
as it had arisen, and they parted at the end
of the day with no outward signs of anger.
</p>

<p>
Later on, when the sun had set and the sea
lisped and murmured down in the little harbour,
Gwladys took her creel on her shoulders, and
made her way across the wet, shining sands.  Her
destination was a creek just round the reef of
rocks that bounded the harbour on the south side,
where Nance Owen gathered her laver weed
every day, leaving it in a shady place until
Gwladys, to whom the work was a labour of love,
could carry it home for her, as she was too weak
and infirm herself.
</p>

<p>
The moon rose round and golden behind the
hills, and already threw black shadows across
the beach.  Gwladys did not sing as usual, but
walked slowly with bent head.
</p>

<p>
Gwen's words rankled in her mind and
troubled her much.  Her love for Ivor had been
so deeply buried, so carefully hidden even from
herself, that it pained and shocked her to have it
thus dragged into the garish light.  But&mdash;&mdash;  "Was
Gwen right? did she love him?" and with
flushed cheeks she was forced to confess to
herself, "Yes&mdash;I love him; but he shall never know
it!"  After crossing the beach, she found the
tide was not low enough for her to reach the
further creek; so, sitting down, she waited,
looking out over the sea which the sunset glow tinted
with a coppery red.  Suddenly a boat came round
the point, and in it Gwladys recognised Ivor.  As
the prow of the boat grated on the shingle, she
rose, and stood uncertain what to do.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!  Gwladys, thee'st mistaken the time
to-night, for the tide won't be down for another
half hour.  See!  I have brought the laver weed
for thee."  And, jumping lightly on the shore,
he filled the creel which she carried on her
shoulders.  "Would'st like a row, lass?"
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed," said Gwladys, "I haven't
been on the water a long time; but my mother
won't know where I am, whatever."
</p>

<p>
"Oh! come, we won't be long&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed, I don't know," she said again,
but at the same time allowing herself to be helped
into the boat.  Slipping the creel from her
shoulders, she took the second oar, for she was as
much accustomed to the boats and the rowing
as any sailor in the place, having spent the greater
part of her childhood on the shore and on the
bay.  They rowed silently for some time out
towards the sunset, where the coppery glow on
the water was beginning to catch the silver of
the moon on its ripples; then shipping their oars,
they floated idly on.  Gwladys bent over the
side of the boat and drew her fingers through
the smooth waters.
</p>

<p>
The moon shone full on Ivor's handsome and
sunburnt face.  They did not speak much, but
in the hearts of both arose a full tide of content
and happiness.  They were alone on the heaving,
whispering waters; sea and sky seemed to fold
them in a mantle of love and beauty; the
bewitching softness of the hour threw its glamour
over them; and though the strong influence of
the situation was felt by both with all the fervour
of youth and romance, they kept their feelings
under strong restraint, and their conversation was
confined to ordinary commonplaces.
</p>

<p>
"Here's a splendid evening!" said Ivor,
stooping also towards the deep green water in
the shadow of the boat.  His voice was low and
tender, and Gwladys drooped her eyes to her
fingers rippling through the water.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, beautiful!  And last night was as beautiful!"
</p>

<p>
"Not quite," said Ivor; "there has never
been such a sunset&mdash;such a moonrise&mdash;I think."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, indeed," said Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"Art going to Gwen's wedding?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I think," she said.
</p>

<p>
"And to the bidding?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose.  Is the Mishteer coming?"
</p>

<p>
"Not to the wedding, I think," said Ivor,
"we couldn't expect the Mishteer to do that,
though he is so isel,[<a id="chap02fn12text"></a><a href="#chap02fn12">12</a>] but to the bidding he will
come&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed!" said Gwladys, "and with his
hand in his pocket I am sure.  He is so kind; he
gave my mother our cow, you know; indeed, I
don't know what we should have done without
him since my father died; but let us go back."
</p>

<p>
"Why," asked Ivor, "art tired? or is there
anyone waiting for thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Tired? no; and nobody is waiting for me,
except my mother, perhaps."
</p>

<p>
"Art sure no lover is waiting thee?"
</p>

<p>
"I am sure," said Gwladys, raising her brown
eyes to his; "I have no lover to wait for me&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Ivor's eyes trembled as he answered:
</p>

<p>
"Thee canst not be sure of that, Gwladys;
perhaps thee hast one who hides his love from
thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed," she said laughing, "he succeeds
in hiding it completely then, for I know
of none; but I think my mother will wonder
where I am, and Nance will come and look for
her laver weed."
</p>

<p>
Ivor did not speak, but, taking up their oars,
they were soon silently cleaving the waves, and
drawing near the shore again.  The night air
swept by them, loosening the girl's hair, which
streamed back on the wind, and sometimes, as
Ivor bent to the oar, it swept across his face,
and for a moment he was tempted with one hand
to press it to his lips, while with the other he
still handled his oar.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys looked round.  "I thought something
pulled my hair?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps!" said Ivor; "who knows?  On a
night like this the mermaids and mermen come
out, and may be one might like to touch thy
hair."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys flushed in the darkness.  She was
sure it was Ivor's hand that had touched her, and
it woke a thrill of happiness within her, an
emotion which, however, she instantly smothered.
</p>

<p>
"He is playing with me," she said, "and he
means no more than the sea breeze means when
it touches my hair."  And they rowed on again
in silence, until they reached the strand on one
side of the harbour.
</p>

<p>
"Wilt come another night, Gwladys?"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, indeed," said the girl, settling her
creel in its place, and jumping lightly from the
prow of the boat on to the rock.
</p>

<p>
As they parted on the shore, the moon shone
full upon her, and Ivor took note afresh of every
charm in the varying expression of her face.
</p>

<p>
"Hast enjoyed it, lass?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, to be sure," she answered.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, nos da."
</p>

<p>
"Nos da," said Gwladys, beginning her way
over the beach.
</p>

<p>
He did not offer to accompany her, and she
thought she understood his reason.
</p>

<p>
"He would not like to be seen walking with
me in the moonlight," she mused.  "Well, he is
right; but he need not fear I would think he
meant anything by it," and she tossed her head
proudly as she entered Nance Owen's cottage
and deposited her basket of weed on the table.
</p>

<p>
The house-door stood wide open, the moonlight
and the sea wind streaming in together, a
few smouldering turfs burnt on the hearth, the
old cat sat beside them and blinked, but Nance
was out gossiping; and Gwladys went out again,
and pursued her uneven path up the village road
to her own home with a strange sense of happiness
in her heart, which would not be stamped
out even by that potent emotion, "Welsh pride."

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
High up the village, and perched on a little
knoll, overlooking what was politely called "the
road," stood a cottage, in nowise different from
the other houses, except that, perhaps, its walls
were whiter and its thatch was browner.  Its
two tiny windows were clear as crystal, an arch
over each being painted brick red; the top of the
door was ornamented in the same way; and
inside, the earthen floor of the passage, which was
almost as hard and shining as marble, had its
edges marked in a bordering of the same dark red.
</p>

<p>
The door stood wide open; indeed, it was
never closed from one year's end to another,
except at night and in stormy weather.  Within
the penisha sat a girl busily knitting, though her
thoughts were evidently not on her work, for her
eyes were fixed dreamily on the sunset sky which
lightened up the little window.  But stay, was
she a girl?  No! if age counts by the number
of years that have passed since birth, for Mari
Vaughan (or Vone, as it is pronounced in Wales)
was thirty-five years of age, and had long taken
her place amongst the elder and soberer portion
of the community; the younger and more
frivolous girls had dropped her out of their
companionship, only remembering her when at times
she appeared amongst them, and then with an
uncomfortable feeling of being eclipsed by her
beauty.  She was tall and graceful, her figure
had lost nothing of the fulness and charm of
youth, her pale golden hair was as luxuriant as
ever, and her face was one to be always
remembered.  She was pale, but not with the hue of
sickness, for her health was perfect; her skin was
not of the milky white, which, in Gwladys' face,
contrasted so beautifully with the glowing cheeks,
but more of an ivory whiteness; her eyes of deep
blue were shaded by the white lids, fringed with
brown lashes; her teeth were even and white,
and rather large; a dimpled cleft in her chin
gave the pale face the amount of spirit and life
which it required; and when she spoke, there was
a liquid softness in her musical voice, which
gave the most ordinary remarks a tone of tenderness.
</p>

<p>
Fifteen years before, she had passed through
a crisis in her life, which had left indelible
traces upon her character.  At twenty she had
given her heart to Hugh Morgan&mdash;the handsomest
and most promising lad in the village&mdash;a
promise which had been amply fulfilled
by his subsequent life.  'N'wncwl Jos, who stood
in the place of parents to the orphan girl, had
given a willing consent.  Hugh had already
bought his business and re-furnished his cottage
home at his father's death, and Mari loved him
with a love deeper, even in its intensity, than she
herself was aware of; but with the thoughtlessness
of youth, petted and indulged by her uncle,
and somewhat spoiled by the attentions of her
lover, she had foolishly listened to the blandishments
of a new suitor, who had appeared in the
village, a sailor, who bore the distinguishing
charm of a foreign name, that of "Alfred
Smith."  Still more interesting, he could not speak a
word of Welsh.  He spoke his own language
with a peculiar accent, which, though in reality
a vulgar Cockney, fascinated the simple Mari,
accustomed only to the broad, strong tones of her
native tongue.  Alas, for the perversity of Fate!
Hugh Morgan, who had noticed a slight coldness
in her manner of late, and, moreover, had
heard sundry gossiping rumours in the village,
had brought matters to a crisis by reproaching
her with her fickleness, and proposing that
her marriage with him should take place at
once.
</p>

<p>
"The house is ready, and I am ready, and
longing for thy presence, Mari.  Art ready thyself?"
</p>

<p>
"No, I am not," was her answer, with a toss
of her head; "and thou mustn't hurry and order
me as if I were a child!"
</p>

<p>
Hugh, who also had the hasty temper of his
race, burst into a flame of passion.
</p>

<p>
"It is that d&mdash;&mdash;d Sais!"[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>] he said, his eyes
flashing and his breath coming in short gasps.
"Thou hadst better tell me the truth at once&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"What truth?" said Mari.
</p>

<p>
"That thou preferrest him to me; that while
I was working for thee by day, and dreaming of
thee at night, a foolish word from the Englishman's
slippery tongue drew thee away from me!
Such love is not worth having!"
</p>

<p>
"If that's how it is, it is not worth giving,"
said Mari; "and so it won't grieve thee to hear
that I have none to give."
</p>

<p>
She spoke in a pert little voice, and with a
toss of her head, very unlike her usual manner.
</p>

<p>
Hugh was silent for a moment, while he tried
to control his angry feelings, and the blood surged
through his veins and sang in his ears.  Had it
come to this?  His deep and unswerving love
for Mari, who had been the star of his life from
boyhood upwards, to be crushed ruthlessly! his
tender feelings to be trampled upon at the word
of a Sais!
</p>

<p>
When he spoke next his voice trembled, and
he was pale and agitated.
</p>

<p>
"Think well, Mari; I am not one to turn
from my word, or to change the colour of my
heart as I change my coat; so think well, lass,
before thou answerest my next question, 'Wilt
have me or not?'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not, then!" said Mari.
</p>

<p>
She seemed to be possessed by a spirit of
perversity, which ever after she wondered at.
</p>

<p>
They had just reached her uncle's, and she
prepared to leave her lover, and enter the
house.
</p>

<p>
"Stop one moment, Mari," he said, grasping
her arm tightly; "remember that although I love
thee now with my whole heart, and will forgive
thee thy fickleness and forget thy folly, if thou
wilt come to me, and draw back thy words&mdash;yet&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Mari was beginning a hasty answer, but he
interrupted her with a fierce&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hush!  listen.  I will sit down there on the
limekiln until the moon has set&mdash;she is not far
from her setting; thou wilt see me by the glow
of the limekiln," and his voice changed to a low,
pleading tone.  "I will be waiting for thee, Mari,
and if thou comest, my arms will be open to
receive thee; but if not, I will <i>never</i> ask thee again;
and, moreover, I will do all in my power to shut
thine image out of my heart."
</p>

<p>
"Nos da," was all her answer, as she entered
the cottage.
</p>

<p>
The house was empty, for 'n'wncwl Jos was
out on one of his fishing expeditions, and
running into the penucha, she bolted the door, and
threw herself on her bed in a perfect storm of
tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Hugh, Hugh, beth na'i?"[<a id="chap03fn2text"></a><a href="#chap03fn2">2</a>]  She knew
now how much she loved him&mdash;how every
feeling of her heart would be torn in losing him.
She knew that the flattery and admiration of Sais
were as nothing to her compared to Hugh
Morgan's love, and yet&mdash;and yet&mdash;she could not
stoop to ask his pardon.  She rose and looked
through the little window; she saw the glow
from the limekiln, and also saw the dark figure
sitting there.  The moon hung very low in the
sky, and she watched it tremblingly.  The clock
struck in the penisha; time was passing, and
soon it would be too late.
</p>

<p>
Another storm of tears&mdash;and she rose again
to look at the dark figure by the limekiln.  The
moon had already touched the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Should she rush out now and ask his
forgiveness?"  She had a feeling that the dim, grey
quietness of the night was a forecast of what her
life would be without Hugh, while the light and
warmth of the glowing kiln portrayed his deep
love for her.  She had but to ask, and she would
be folded in its mantle of happiness.  But the
moon&mdash;she's gone!&mdash;and Mari fell sobbing on
the floor.
</p>

<p>
She was roused by the stumping of 'n'wncwl
Jos's wooden leg, and rose slowly and straightened
herself, and, turning to the window, saw the dark
figure by the limekiln was gone; and she passed
over the threshold of the penucha with a strange
perception that all the delight, the passionate
love, the intense enjoyment of life were left
behind her, and that the future contained for her
only the dim and grey quietness of evening.  But
this was fifteen years ago, and Hugh had never
asked her again.  She had never spoken to Alfred
Smith afterwards.  The very thought of him
was hateful to her.
</p>

<p>
As the long years went by, she and Hugh
were frequently thrown together in that small
community.  They learnt to meet without
embarrassment, and to part without a pang; and
gradually Hugh's strong nature found its solace in
his work, and in the ever-increasing claims of his
work-people upon his time and thoughts.  He
alone knew how hard had been the struggle to
regain calmness and comparative content after
the shattering of his hopes which Mari's
fickleness had brought upon him; but it came at last,
and he thought he had entirely got over his old
love-affair.
</p>

<p>
True, no day seemed complete on which he
had not seen Mari Vone.  His love for her had
developed into a perfect friendship&mdash;so he
thought.  He scarcely ever arranged a business
transaction without asking her advice, and
although she was not employed in his sail-shed,
every incident connected with his work was laid
before her, and her opinion on every matter
weighed much with him.
</p>

<p>
She had never married, neither had Hugh,
and their intercourse had outwardly lost every
trace of the romance which once hung round it.
Thus it was with Hugh Morgan; but what had
the years brought to Mari?  At first a deep and
bitter regret, a wild unrest, which nothing but
pride enabled her to hide.  She knew that the
misunderstanding between her and her lover was
the subject of much gossiping interest around
her, and she determined that no one should guess
her sorrow, or see any sign of her pain.  She
schooled herself to meet Hugh with calmness
and outward indifference, though not a tone of
his voice or a change of looks or manner
escaped her notice.  Deep in her heart she
nourished her undying love for him, and when, as
time went on, she saw that a warm friendship
had taken the place of love in his heart, she
endeavoured, with the unselfishness of a true
woman, to accommodate herself to his wishes and
ideas.
</p>

<p>
The fifteen years that had passed since she
and Hugh had watched the moon sink beneath
the horizon with such tumultuous feelings, had
scarcely altered her or aged her in the least.
Time seemed to have stood still with her, or to
hesitate to lay his destroying finger upon her
charms of person, although on her spirit his hand
was ever setting new and tender graces, and
as she sat at her knitting, with her eyes fixed
on the sunset, her ear was strained to catch
the faintest sound of an approaching footstep.
And here it comes.  And in the darkening
twilight Hugh Morgan stoops his head as he
enters the low doorway.  Mari did not rise;
these visits were of too frequent occurrence
for ceremony, and she merely looked up from
her shining needles as the stalwart form
stood before her, asking, "Where's 'n'wncwl
Jos?"
</p>

<p>
"He's not come in; wilt look for him?  Most
like he is smoking on the lower limekiln."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will wait."
</p>

<p>
"B'tshwr,"[<a id="chap03fn3text"></a><a href="#chap03fn3">3</a>] said Mari, rising and pushing
the rush chair towards him; "supper will be
ready directly," she said.  "We have fresh
buttermilk from Glanynys."
</p>

<p>
"And potatoes?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will stop and have some, for that is
a dish Madlen always spoils."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis pity, indeed; I must show her how to
do them."
</p>

<p>
"Can diolch,"[<a id="chap03fn4text"></a><a href="#chap03fn4">4</a>] he said.
</p>

<p>
"What dost want 'n'wncwl Jos for&mdash;anything
particular?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh, "I want his advice&mdash;and
yours, Mari, on a subject very important to me.
But here is 'n'wncwl Jos!"
</p>

<p>
As the old man stumped in, he greeted Hugh
with the usual friendly "Hello!  Mishteer,"
before he seated himself on the settle, Mari at once
placing beside him a bucket of sea-sand, into
which he squirted his tobacco juice with unerring
aim, for he had learned under Mari's regime to
dread a spot upon the speckless floor.  Hugh
had taken out his pipe, and the two men were
soon sending wreaths of smoke up the big, open
chimney, as they sat round the bright fire of
culm[<a id="chap03fn5text"></a><a href="#chap03fn5">5</a>] balls.
</p>

<p>
Gwen's approaching marriage was the subject
of conversation.
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed, I think he's a lucky chap,"
said 'n'wncwl Jos, "for she's a tidy girl, and
saving, and steady."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, very good girl," said Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Ivor Parry will have to find new lodgings
now," said Mari.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Mary the Mill is glad to have him.
Are you going to the wedding, Mari?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have promised.  You are not, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, no&mdash;but I am going to the bidding."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there's what I heard."
</p>

<p>
"I was thinking that would be enough," he
said.  "What do you think?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite enough," said Mari.  "Being the
Mishteer, they would scarcely expect you to
both; and if you went to this one, you would
offend others by refusing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Exactly what I was thinking," said Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"We had better have supper now," said Mari,
"the potatoes are done."  And taking the huge
crock which hung by a chain from the wide
chimney, she placed it on the floor, and with the
large wooden spoon or "lletwad" mashed the
snowy potatoes into a steaming paste, adding a
little salt and cream.  From this crock she partly
filled the black, shining bowls which were ranged
on the table, placing a wooden spoon for herself
and her uncle.  A large jug of buttermilk stood
in the centre of the table.
</p>

<p>
For the Mishteer, Mari placed a quaint, slender
silver spoon; but he indignantly pushed it
away, and she laughingly substituted for it a
wooden one like her own.
</p>

<p>
"Mari, f√¢ch," he said, "what dost think I
am made of that I should eat out of a silver spoon
while thou art satisfied with a wooden one?  Not
I, indeed!  Well, I don't think anyone ever did
cook potatoes like thee.  More?  Caton pawb! no,
I have made two suppers in one."
</p>

<p>
After supper she closed the door, and throwing
a log over the culm fire made it blaze up
brightly.
</p>

<p>
A spirit of rest and content came over Hugh,
which he invariably felt in her presence.  Her
needles clicked, and her golden head was bent
over her work; the shining points of her little
shoes peeped out under her red petticoat; and
as she chatted cheerfully, her white teeth
glistening and her dimpled chin adding its charm to
her fair pale face, even 'n'wncwl Jos noticed how
fair she was to look upon.  Hugh was accustomed
to sudden awakenings to her charms, but
had schooled and hardened himself against their
influence.  Besides, to-night he was pre-occupied&mdash;his
thoughts were full of something else.  The
clock in the corner struck nine, drawing near
bedtime in that simple village.
</p>

<p>
"Howyr b√¢ch!" said Hugh, with a start; "it
will be time to go before I have said what I
wanted to."
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" inquired Mari.
</p>

<p>
"Well, thou know'st," he answered, "I always
like 'n'wncwl Jos's advice; and&mdash;and I am
thinking of getting married."
</p>

<p>
Mari's heart stood still; and at that moment,
while her needles continued to click, and she
showed no sign of the agony within her even
then, the hope that had been nourished for
fifteen years died; not the love, for that was all
enduring and undying.  And while she passed
through a spasm of pain, she yet raised her white
lids calmly, and looking full into Hugh Morgan's
face, said:
</p>

<p>
"It will be better for thee than living alone."
</p>

<p>
"Diws anwl!" said 'n'wncwl Jos; "there's
news I'll have to give in the sail-shed to-morrow.
Nobody'll listen to the war in China."
</p>

<p>
"Stop, stop," said Hugh; "you must tell no
one: Perhaps the girl won't have me, man.
Wait until I give you leave."  And turning
his black eyes upon those into which he had
once looked with passionate love, he said,
"I'm afraid, Mari, thou wilt not approve of my
choice."
</p>

<p>
"Who is she?" asked Mari.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys Price."
</p>

<p>
There was a dead silence for a moment.  Mari
put down her knitting; 'n'wncwl Jos changed
his quid from one cheek to the other.
</p>

<p>
"J√¢r-i!" he said; "she's a nice girl."
</p>

<p>
"What dost say, Mari?" said Hugh; "too
young, dost think?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," she answered calmly, "she's the best
girl in the village; and if she does not think
herself too young, it won't matter what others
think."
</p>

<p>
"There's just what I was thinking," said
Hugh.  "Mari, thou art always a sensible woman.
She has no other lover, and er&mdash;and er&mdash;in
fact, I love her.  I have been a lonely man for
years&mdash;since the old days, Mari.  Nay, don't
blush; I'm not blaming thee, lass.  And perhaps
if it had been otherwise, we wouldn't now be
such perfect friends."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, indeed," said Mari, beginning to
recover her equanimity.  She saw in her mind's
eye another long stretch of arid desert before
her; but her courage rose, and her love was not
quenched.  She would still be his friend, and
that could bring nothing but blessing upon him.
Though unchanged and undiminished in its
depth and fervour, her love had become more
and more free from the selfishness and taint of
earthly passion.
</p>

<p>
"Well, in my little deed!" said 'n'wncwl Jos,
"if any girl in Mwntseison could tempt me to
do such a foolish thing as to get married, 'twould
be Gwladys Price."
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb!" said Hugh, with a merry
ring in his voice, which was not lost upon Mari's
quick ear; "don't you go and be my rival now,
'n'wncwl Jos, or I will have no chance, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"No doubt, no doubt!" answered the old
man, with, a perfect storm of laughter and stumps
of his wooden leg.
</p>

<p>
Mari went on knitting quietly.  "Thou hast
my best wishes, Hugh," she said at last, looking
up into his face; "thou know'st that."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh laconically.  He took her
hand in his, and for a moment he longed to ask
her if his marriage would cost her one pang of
pain; but with the memory of the long years of
calm friendship lying between them and that
evening when the moon set too soon for both,
how could he ask such a question?  So he was
silent, and the opportunity went by for ever.
"Nos da!"[<a id="chap03fn6text"></a><a href="#chap03fn6">6</a>] was all he said, "and hundred
thanks for your good wishes.  Nos da, 'n'wncwl
Jos; none of this in the sail-shed, mind, until I
give you leave."
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" said the old man; "but diws anwl,
don't be long."  And he stumped his wooden leg
four or five times on the ground.
</p>

<p>
Outside in the moonlight Hugh Morgan
walked a few paces, with his head rather drooping
on his chest, thinking, not of his new love,
but of his old.  How fair she was still! how
sweet and tender! how true and tried a friend!
God grant that through life her friendship might
continue his!
</p>

<p>
At the turn of the path he came in sight
of Gwladys' cottage.  A light was in the
window, and a figure passed and re-passed before
it.  The night breeze blew straight from him
to the cottage, and on its wings Hugh sent a
fervent "God bless her!" while a light awoke
in his eyes and a flush rose into his face,
which, he was glad to remember, no one could
see.
</p>

<p>
"Only eighteen!" he said, "and I&mdash;forty! old
enough to be her father!  Will she have me?
If she will, she shall never repent it; my love
shall hedge her in, and shield her from every
earthly ill."  And as he entered his house he felt
as he had not done for years&mdash;how lonely it was,
and he pictured Gwladys' presence lighting up
the quiet hearth.
</p>

<p>
When he smoked his last pipe tender the big
chimney his thoughts returned to Mari.
</p>

<p>
"How completely she had forgotten the old
days! and what a good thing it was!  'It will
be better for thee than living alone!'  Kind
friend, she always knew what was wisest and
best!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
GWEN'S "BIDDING."
</h3>

<p>
Gwen and Siencyn had been married in the
morning with much fluttering of ribbons and
firing of guns.  The Speedwell, at anchor in the
bay, gaily bedecked with pennons and flags, was
to sail away for Ireland with the evening tide,
bearing the happy Siencyn and his bride on their
honeymoon voyage.  Each having a frugal mind,
meant to combine business with pleasure, and,
therefore, were to carry with them in the hold a
cargo of slates.  But a more important function
even than the wedding was to take place in the
afternoon, namely, "the bidding."  A week
before, the invitations had been sent out&mdash;two men
of substantial standing in the village having, in
the usual fashion, volunteered to leave the
"bidding" letters at every farm or cottage in the
parish.  They were printed in the same formula,
as they had borne for generations, and were as
follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"DEAR FRIENDS,&mdash;As it is our intention to
enter the matrimonial state, we are encouraged
by our friends to make a 'bidding,' which will
be held on Monday, the 28th inst., at our own
house in Mwntseison, in the parish of Abersethin.
Your agreeable company on the occasion is
humbly solicited; and whatever donation you may be
pleased to confer on us then will be gratefully
received, and repaid whenever called for.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  "We are, dear friends,<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Your obedient servants,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"SIENCYN OWEN,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"GWEN HUGHES.<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"The young man, together with his mother
and brother, desire that all gifts due to them will
be returned to him on that day, and will be
thankful for all additional favours.
</p>

<p>
"The young woman and her mother desire
that all gifts due to them be returned to her on
that day, and will be thankful for all favours
granted.
</p>

<p>
"N.B.&mdash;All gifts due to the young man's late
father, Robert Owen, are humbly solicited to be
repaid."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
In earlier years this outspoken reminder was
couched in still plainer terms:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Come," it said, "with your goodwill on the
plate; bring current money&mdash;a shilling, or two,
or three, or four, or five, with cheese and butter.
We invite the husband and wife, and children
and men servants, from the greatest to the least."
</p>

<p>
And it promised "drink cheap, stools to sit
on, and fish, if we can catch them; but if not,
hold us excusable."
</p>

<p>
With this insinuating reminder before them,
every householder began to search the stores of
his memory.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see," said one of the invited, "what
did Lallo give our Nell?  A shilling, I think it
was; and old Peggi Sh√¢n, her mother, gave a
sixpence, I know, for I remember Nell's burying it
in the garden, for she was afraid of a witch's
money&mdash;that's eighteen pence for me."
</p>

<p>
"J√¢r-i, what must I give?" said 'n'wncwl Jos,
scratching his head.  "Old Peggi Sh√¢n came to
thy mother's bidding, Mari, and gave sixpence,
for I kiwked[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>] at it as it went into the basin, and
I fished it out pretty sharp.  'Ach y fi!' I said,
'no witch's money for my sister!' and sure as
I'm here, 'twas a <i>bad</i> sixpence; so I don't owe
much to Gwen."
</p>

<p>
But when the bidding day arrived, 'n'wncwl
Jos was one of the noisiest and merriest there,
welcoming the guests as if he were the father
of the bride.  "Dewch 'mewn! dewch 'mewn!"[<a id="chap04fn2text"></a><a href="#chap04fn2">2</a>]
and he guided each fresh arrival to the door of a
disused cowhouse at the end of the garden, where
Gwen sat in state just inside the door, across
which a table had been placed; on this table
stood a basin covered with a plate ready to
receive the gifts of her friends.  As soon as a piece
of money was put upon it Gwen tilted the plate,
and emptied its contents into the basin, replacing
it again empty and ready for the next donation.
</p>

<p>
"Come along!" said 'n'wncwl Jos, piloting
Gwladys Price to the door, "here's the bride!
Nothing less than a shilling now, Nani! for you
don't know how soon Gwen will have to return it."
</p>

<p>
Nani smiled.  "Not too soon I hope; I
don't want to lose my daughter yet."
</p>

<p>
She dropped a shilling on the plate, and
Gwladys followed with her modest sixpence.
Everybody said "Priodas dda i chi!"[<a id="chap04fn3text"></a><a href="#chap04fn3">3</a>] as he or
she turned away to make room for another.
</p>

<p>
Gwen was very smiling and grateful as the
sixpences and shillings and even half-crowns
came tumbling on to the plate, and the basin had
several times to be handed over to the bridesmaid,
who quickly slipped an empty one in its
place.
</p>

<p>
"What a good bidding she's having," whispered
the women to each other, as they kept a
keen eye on the numerous changes of basins.
"Why!  I've seen a pink and a green and a blue
on the board already!  Siencyn has done a good
thing for himself, whatever!"
</p>

<p>
There was a little excitement in the company
as Hugh Morgan came down between the
cabbage-beds, followed by Ivor Parry, and there
was quite a craning of necks to see how much
the Mishteer put on the plate.
</p>

<p>
"A gold sovereign, as sure as I'm here!"
said a woman to her neighbours; "and Ivor
Parry two crown pieces!  Wel wyr! there's rich
she'll be!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Mishteer b√¢ch!" said Gwen, "a piece
of gold!  Wel wyr! did man ever hear of such
a thing!  A hundred thanks!" and she rose to
make a bob curtsey.  "Well, indeed, indeed, you
are too kind, and you must let Siencyn always
carry your culm and coal in the Speedwell for
nothing!  Oh, yes, indeed you must!  And I
thank thee, too, Ivor Parry, and hope to return
thy gift soon at thine own bidding!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Priodas dda," said both men, shaking
hands and turning towards the house, where the
fun and merriment began to wax loud and furious
under the influence of the "cwrw da,"[<a id="chap04fn4text"></a><a href="#chap04fn4">4</a>]
which Siencyn dispensed with liberal hand.
</p>

<p>
In the penisha a crowd of women sat round a
long table drinking tea and eating "light cakes,"
a delicious kind of batter cake, considered
indispensable at a Welsh festive gathering; while in
the penucha every guest of the opposite sex was
expected to taste the ale which had been brewed
for the occasion, and to eat one of the
diamond-shaped "bidding cakes."  Here there was much
boisterous laughter and loud talking, which was
somewhat hushed as the Mishteer entered.
</p>

<p>
"A 'blue' for the Mishteer!" shouted somebody
to Siencyn, who presided at the tap.  And
Hugh drained his cup, and placed his cake in his
pocket.  Having wished Siencyn "Priodas dda,"
and made a few joking remarks to the men, who
had soon recovered from their momentary
silence, he made his way into the penisha, where
Gwladys Price and her mother were coming to
an end of their tea and light cakes, Dye Pentraeth
having deserted them for the more potent charms
of the beer barrel.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said Hugh, "this is more in my
line; a cup of tea, Esther!" and he took a vacant
seat next to Gwladys, who blushed at the honour,
and handed him a plate of light cakes.
</p>

<p>
"How fortunate for me to find this seat vacant,
Gwladys, unless, indeed, thou wert keeping
it for someone else."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, indeed," stammered the girl, for her
tender conscience told her she had not been
without hope that Ivor might come in and fill it; but
he had been pounced upon by a fat farm wife,
who kept him in attendance upon her and her
daughter&mdash;the little tricks of society not being
confined to one class.
</p>

<p>
Hugh made most of his time.  His sparkling
black eyes and ready wit, together with a certain
earnestness of manner and a superior education
to that of his neighbours, gave an indefinable
charm to his conversation, which the simple
women around him were not slow to feel, though
they could not have explained it in words.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys, amused and flattered, was soon chatting
and laughing unrestrainedly, her face
glowing with the fun and excitement of the occasion.
Deep below the surface was the unconfessed
longing for Ivor's presence, and when at last he
entered the room, and took his seat on the opposite
side of the table, she found it difficult to keep
up her interest in her companion's conversation.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Morgan's experiences of life being limited
to one small village, in the shelter of a lonely
bay, he had no great range of subjects upon
which to dilate; but his natural good taste and
intelligence made him aware that the daily
occupation of the sail-shed had better be kept in the
background, and he confined himself to the fairs
and eisteddfods of the neighbourhood, and
amused Gwladys by a description of a competition
in which he had been adjudicator, where the
three competitors had quarrelled so violently on
the platform, that they had to be turned out of
the meeting.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anwl!  I wish I had been there," she
said.
</p>

<p>
"I was there," said Ivor.  "I am sorry, Mishteer,
to call you away, but Captain Roberts wants
to see you about those sails which were torn so
much in the last gale.  Will I take him a
message for you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said Hugh, rising at once; "business
must be attended to.  Come and take care
of Gwladys while I am gone."  And Ivor,
nothing loth, took his place beside her.
</p>

<p>
"What a good bidding Gwen has had," she
said, examining her plate shyly.
</p>

<p>
It was the general opinion, but Ivor did not
agree with it.  He shrugged his shoulders, and
said:
</p>

<p>
"A bad bidding I call it.  I have not seen
thee to speak a word to to-day."
</p>

<p>
The pattern on Gwladys' plate seemed to
interest her still more.
</p>

<p>
"The Mishteer has been making me laugh
about the Abersethin Eisteddfod," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;I was glad to see him so lively; it is
seldom he speaks to a woman; and a good thing
they say, for they all fall in love with him."
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed, there is something very nice
about him," said Gwladys.  "I can't think how
Mari Vone refused him.  She did once, they
say."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, so I have heard.  Not often do parted
lovers become such good friends as they are."
</p>

<p>
While he had been speaking, he had poured
out a glass of the foaming cwrw which Siencyn
had just brought in, and he held it towards the
girl, who shook her head, saying, "I prefer tea."
</p>

<p>
"But thou'lt drink from my hand," he said,
in a low tone; and Gwladys, knowing that a
refusal to the request, "Drink from my hand,"
would be reckoned an insult, smilingly took the
glass and put her lips to it.
</p>

<p>
"No more?  I will drink the rest to thy
health then, lass, and may thy life be full of love
and happiness!  Wilt wish something for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I wish thee the same!" and Ivor
seemed satisfied.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys was in a dream of bliss, and it was
only when Hugh Morgan returned, and Ivor
rose to make room for him, that she began as
usual to fear that she had made her preference
for the latter too apparent.  She called herself to
task for her too evident happiness in his presence,
and her dissatisfaction at his absence.
</p>

<p>
"What do I expect?" she said.  "Ivor is
kind and pleasant, but he does not love me; <i>that</i>
I know full well!"
</p>

<p>
Later in the afternoon, when the guests were
beginning to disperse, and the sound of the waves
came fuller and plainer through the open
windows, everyone knew it was nearly full tide, and
time for Siencyn and Gwen to take their
departure.  The money collected at the bidding was
counted, and the bride was loudly congratulated
upon the large amount.
</p>

<p>
"Thirty pounds&mdash;enough to set the young
couple up in comfort!"
</p>

<p>
It was entrusted to Lallo's keeping, and later
in the evening she handed it over with much
pride to Hugh Morgan, who stood in the place
of "banker" to the whole village.
</p>

<p>
A large party of the young people attended
the happy couple to the shore, singing as they
went an old part song of farewell greeting.
</p>

<p>
There was no way of reaching the boat that
was to carry them to the Speedwell which danced
and dipped in the bay, so Siencyn unceremoniously
took off his shoes and stockings, and,
hoisting his bride on his shoulders, waded
through the surf, amongst the shouts and laughter
and boisterous "hwr√©'s" of the company.
They waited on the shore until the Speedwell
was fairly under weigh, and with fluttering
pennons and flags had disappeared round the horn
of the bay.
</p>

<p>
All the evening, and late into the moonlight,
the lads and lasses of the village kept up the
festive character of the day, sitting about in knots
on the rocks and cliffs, and of course singing to
their hearts' content.  Lallo alone seemed rather
depressed as she led her pig home from a neighbour's
stye, to which it had been banished for the
day; he was now evidently in a hurry to get back
to his own home, tugging violently at the string
tied to his leg, which Lallo held.  When he was
safely housed, she stood somewhat tearfully
thinking.  Her life was a constant warfare with
her pig, and either her voice or his, or both
together, were generally to be heard.  He had in
every way disappointed her.  She had meant
him to be a fat and short pig; but instead of that
he had grown long, and when he stood on his
hind feet to argue with her, he was taller than
the gate!  She had had a board added to the
top, but the pig had grown still longer, and was
still able to put his head over the gate and
vociferate his remonstrances.
</p>

<p>
"There, thou villain!" said Lallo, pouring a
steaming bucketful of food into his trough;
"hold thy tongue if thou canst."
</p>

<p>
"Oo'ee&mdash;oo'ee&mdash;oo'ee!" shrieked the pig, and
Lallo imitating his tones derisively, the noise was
deafening.  At last, retiring from the frequent
fray, she threw herself down on the settle in the
penisha, from which all the guests had departed,
and where nothing but the remains of the feast
were left.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she mused, "it is just as well that
Gwen is married; there will now be a man to
manage him; he wants a firmer hand than
mine&mdash;the villain!  Ivor never managed him
properly.  Now I will take the money to the
Mishteer."
</p>

<p>
She had no sooner appeared at her front door
than the pig assailed her with a fresh burst of
"Oo'ee&mdash;oo'ees!" and Lallo shook her fist at
him.
</p>

<p>
"Devil!" she said; "but never mind, my
boy, wait till the fifth of September."
</p>

<p>
A few days afterwards, when the evening
shadows were falling, Gwladys took her way to
the beach, again to fill her creel for Nance Owen.
The sun was sinking behind the sea in a glory
of purple and gold, making a crimson pathway,
which broadened out at her feet.  She stood and
gazed over the rippling surface, wondering
whether Ivor was out fishing this evening.  Once
or twice a little boat crossed the shining
pathway like a grey moth, and she called to mind the
happy hour she had spent with him on the
moon-lit bay.  Would it ever happen again?  Why
did it seem so distant and so impossible?  Is
this his boat coming swiftly towards her?  She
heard the grating of the prow on the sand, she
saw a stalwart form, who leapt to the shore, and
walked hurriedly towards her.  For a moment
her heart beat faster, but only for a moment, for
she saw the broad shoulders and firm step
belonged to Hugh Morgan.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys!" he called, "is it thee?  Luck
follows me to-day.  This morning brought me
good news, and this evening brings me something
better.  Wilt come in my boat for a row?
It is real summer on the water this evening."
</p>

<p>
"I would like it; but, indeed, Mishteer, I
can't, for Nance Owen will want her laver weed,
and my creel is full."
</p>

<p>
"Nance can wait," said Hugh, "and I will
loosen thy creel."  And he began to loosen the
strap which crossed her bosom.  She did not
think of resisting; "it was the Mishteer!"  And
she quietly helped to slip her head out of the
strap.  It was not without some measure of gratified
vanity that she felt herself singled out from
all the other girls in the village by his kindness;
and therefore it was with a little flutter of pride
that she allowed herself to be lifted into the boat,
though the glamour which had brooded over sea
and sky during her row with Ivor was absent.  It
was evident to her that the Mishteer was pleased
with her work, and perhaps with her industry;
but that he loved her had never dawned upon her
mind.  She took her oar naturally&mdash;every man,
woman, and child at Mwntseison being perfectly
at home on the water&mdash;and they rowed straight
out towards the sunset, until the shore and
village looked like a pretty vignette.
</p>

<p>
"There's nice, it is!" exclaimed Gwladys,
"out here on the bay!  'Tis pity, indeed, that
we can't come oftener!"
</p>

<p>
"And why not?" said Hugh, resting his oars
on the rowlocks, and motioning to her to do the
same.
</p>

<p>
"Wel indeed, Mishteer," she answered,
laughing, "what would become of the work
then?  Who would make the sails?"
</p>

<p>
"Somebody else might," said Hugh; and he
was silent for some time.  "If I had my way,"
he said at last, "thou shouldst have a boat of
thine own.  Wouldst like that, lass?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anwl!  What would I do with a
boat&mdash;alone on the water?  'Twould soon become
wearisome."
</p>

<p>
"But thou shouldst not be alone; I would
row thee, Gwladys."
</p>

<p>
"Mishteer!" was all her answer.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Gwladys.  Hast not seen that I love
thee? dost not know that all I have I would
gladly give for thy love?"
</p>

<p>
His voice trembled, his eyes flashed, and the
hand which held the oar in its nervous grasp
shook like a leaf.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys was too astonished to think.  She
stooped over the soft, undulating water, pretending
to look into its depths; and when at last
his passionate words revealed plainly his meaning,
she could only bend her head and ask timidly:
</p>

<p>
"Me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thee," said Hugh.  "Canst not understand
that my happiness is in thine hands?"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys clasped her hands.  "Oh, Mishteer!"
she said, "I don't understand your words,
or what you want of me."
</p>

<p>
"I want thee, Gwladys, to come and be the
brightness of my home, the idol of my love&mdash;to
be my wife, lass!"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys covered her face with her hands to
hide her mingled feelings of astonishment and
fright.
</p>

<p>
"It was the Mishteer!&mdash;he who had been
mainstay and protector to her mother and herself
ever since her father's death&mdash;to whom their
cottage belonged&mdash;to whom they owed a year's
rent&mdash;who had, in fact, loaded them with kindnesses
and brightened their lives.  And it was he who
now desired to confer upon her this great
honour.  To be the Mishteer's wife!&mdash;she, a girl of
eighteen, to be raised over all the other girls of
the village; to own his house, his riches, and
(above all) his heart!  It was too wonderful for
her to realize!  But why&mdash;oh! why did not Ivor
love her like this?"
</p>

<p>
All this flashed through her mind while she
covered her face.  Hugh came nearer, and,
gently trying to draw away her hands, spoke again
(and his voice was trembling and husky):
</p>

<p>
"Thou canst not love me!  Tell me,
Gwladys&mdash;hast any other lover?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" said the girl&mdash;"indeed, no!
Nobody loves me!  But, Mishteer&mdash;you are
mistaken; you cannot care for-me&mdash;a poor girl, a
fisherman's daughter, the humblest and poorest
of your work-people!"
</p>

<p>
"I love thee," he said, taking both her hands
in his; "and I am content that it should be all
on my side at first&mdash;only at first, Gwladys&mdash;for
my deep love for thee must in time awaken the
same in thine heart for me.  I know thou canst
not love me now&mdash;I am so much older than thee.
I cannot expect thee yet to care for a great rough
fellow like me&mdash;but marry me, and I will change
thy coldness to love!  Believe me!  Wilt try me,
lass?"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys was trembling all over as she answered,
"I cannot, Mishteer; oh! indeed I cannot!"
</p>

<p>
"Why not?"
</p>

<p>
"Because I am frightened and surprised."
</p>

<p>
"Dost dislike me then?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!  indeed, indeed we all love you; I
love you Mishteer, but not&mdash;not as a girl ought
to love her&mdash;lover."
</p>

<p>
"Say husband, Gwladys."
</p>

<p>
"Well, her husband."
</p>

<p>
"But I am satisfied to wait for that love.
Wilt have me, girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Mishteer, we have drifted far out to
sea; let us turn back; let me go home to
mother&mdash;give me time."
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" said Hugh, beginning to use
his oar again; "let us go back.  I will not take
thine answer here alone on the sea&mdash;I ought not
to have asked thee; but to-morrow, Gwladys,
to-morrow evening at this time, I will come to thee
for my answer."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," whispered the girl, as she bent with a
will to her oar.
</p>

<p>
The tide had turned, and the long billowy
swells carried them swiftly back towards the land;
a belated seagull floated by them, a sound of
singing came fitfully on the breeze from the
shore.
</p>

<p>
"They are practising the anthem at Brynseion
Chapel," said the girl, anxious to change the
conversation; "they will wonder where I am."
</p>

<p>
"And I," said Hugh, "have been absent twice
lately.  I will go there at once, and make it all
right for thee; thou wouldst like to go home to
thy mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was all she said.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the shore Hugh once
more took her in his arms to lift her from the
boat, and placing her gently on the sands, he
grasped her hand, and for a moment retained it
in his own.
</p>

<p>
"At least wilt not deceive me, lass?"
</p>

<p>
"Deceive you, Mishteer!  Oh! no, indeed;
you are the Mishteer, and I am only Gwladys
Price, but I never could break my word."
</p>

<p>
"Must I wait longer for the kiss that I am
longing for?" he said.
</p>

<p>
She bent her head and made no answer; but
she did not run away, and Hugh, gently drawing
her towards him, imprinted a passionate kiss on
her full red lips.
</p>

<p>
"Shall I come with thee, or wilt go alone?"
</p>

<p>
"I would rather go alone," said Gwladys,
and she left him pulling his boat up the little
strand.
</p>

<p>
Her mind was full of confused emotions&mdash;astonishment,
pride, admiration for the man whom
she considered so much above her, wonder why
the events of the night left, her so dissatisfied;
and above all, her heart was sore with longing
for Ivor's love!  She dropped her creel of
laver-weed at Nance Owen's door, and as she reached
the village road, with every step her heart asked
the weary question, "Why&mdash;why is it not Ivor?"
</p>

<p>
Darkness had fallen, and the moon, hidden
by a bank of clouds, shed no light on the scene;
but every step of the road was familiar to
Gwladys.  She moved aside to make room for a
rumbling car which came noisily down the hill,
its occupants talking loudly, and&mdash;surely one of
the voices was Ivor's!  There were three sitting
close together on the board which did duty for
a seat, the driver and Ivor, and between them a
girl, around whom the latter's arm was thrown,
and who seemed content with his protection.
She knew Ivor had been absent from the village
since the previous day, for he had accompanied
the delayed sails in the waggon to their
destination on Aberython quay; and from there he was
now returning rather hurriedly, for the purpose
of consulting the Mishteer on some matter of
business which had cropped up at the little town.
He was bringing with him a cousin, who was to
stay some weeks at his lodgings for change of
air; she was a delicate girl, far gone in
consumption, and his kindly thought had suggested a
short sojourn at Mwntseison.  The drive had
shaken her much, and he had held her up with
his strong arm, until he had lifted her safely out
of the car, and placed her under his landlady's
care.
</p>

<p>
After a hasty visit to Hugh Morgan he
returned the same night to Aberython.
</p>

<p>
A spasm of jealousy was added to the dull
aching already filling Gwladys' heart, and as she
plodded on up the hill, she called herself to task,
and blamed herself for her misery.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! if mother knew," she said, "that her
little daughter had been so bold and so foolish as
to give her heart to a man who had never asked
for it, what would she say?  What did she say
about Gwen?  'When a girl shows her love too
plainly, a wise man draws back!'  Have I shown
my love to Ivor? and is he drawing back
because of that?  I will be more careful&mdash;and I
don't love him! to-night I feel I hate him!  And
who was that bold girl, I wonder, who sat with
him? not Madlen, nor Sh√¢n, nor Ana!  But why
do I care?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, mother, I am tired!" she added, as she
entered the house, and threw herself wearily on
the settle.
</p>

<p>
Her mother looked at her with surprise, for
the words, "I am tired, mother!" had been left
behind with her childish frocks and bare feet.
</p>

<p>
"Come to supper, merch i.  Where hast
been?"
</p>

<p>
"On the shore and the water," said Gwladys,
in a listless tone.  "Mother, I have something
wonderful to tell thee!"

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
TRAETH-Y-DARAN.
</h3>

<p>
The business which called Ivor Parry to
Aberython had proved more wearily slow in its
progress than is usual, even in that land where
to attend to a thing at once, and to compass its
completion without delay, is considered not only
unnecessarily flurrying, but also scarcely
dignified; so a whole week went by before he
returned to Mwntseison.
</p>

<p>
He had never been so long absent before, and
was returning one evening in the following week
with a fund of bright, fresh interest in his work
in the old sail-shed.  He was in good spirits,
having finished the Mishteer's work satisfactorily,
and was bringing with him an order for new sails
for the Lapwing; and besides all this, did not
his way lie down the hill past Gwladys' cottage? and
had he not found an excuse for going in as
he passed?
</p>

<p>
And then he fell to wondering what Hugh
Morgan meant when he had said good-bye to
him with the words, "I will have something to
tell thee on thy return."  What was it? Ivor
wondered.
</p>

<p>
"Something pleasant, I know, by the twinkle
in his eye; perhaps an order for the new schooner
at Caer Madoc!"  And as he trudged down the
hill, his thumbs in his armholes, he began to sing
lustily one of the old ballads always floating
about in the country air:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "In a garden of flowers I roamed one day,<br />
  And I said, I will find me a posy gay;<br />
  I passed the red roses and lilies so fair&mdash;<br />
  And a handful of nettles I gathered there!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Twt, twt!" he said, stopping suddenly;
"there's a grumbling song I've got hold of this
fine evening."  And he began again in another
key, and filled the summer air with melody:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Alone on the shore of the stormy bay<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snow-white sea-gull stands;<br />
  And she preens her feathers damp with spray<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the wet and shining sands.<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Perhaps 'tis a maiden who stands to-day<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All wet in a rain of tears;<br />
  And perhaps she will weep by that stormy bay,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through all the coming years!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Well, tan i marw!  That's not much better,"
he said.  "What's the matter with the
man?" And reaching Nani Price's cottage, he
stooped his head, and entered the low doorway.
"Hello, Nani!" he called, and she rose from the
dark chimney corner.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, wyr![<a id="chap05fn1text"></a><a href="#chap05fn1">1</a>]  Ivor, thy voice came in at
the door before thee!  I am glad to see thee
back again.  And what dost think of Aberython?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, 'tis very well," answered Ivor.  "There's
a fine street going down to the quay, and shops
all the way on both sides," and he thought joyfully
of the pretty ribbon he had safe in his pocket
for Gwladys.  "But where's Gwladys?" he asked,
looking round; "not come home from the sail-shed
yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she's not been there to-day; she's gone
to Mari Vone's with patterns of wool for the
weaving.  Thou'st come to wish her joy, no
doubt, like all the rest?"
</p>

<p>
"Wish her joy! of what?" said Ivor, sitting
down on the end of the spinning-wheel
bench.  There was a curious darkening of the
sunshine at the doorway and a confused
rushing in his head which made him glad to sit
down.
</p>

<p>
"Hast not heard the news, then?" said Nani.
"Why, she's going to be married to the
Mishteer!"  And the good woman, for once forgetting
everything but her own satisfaction, in the
information she had to impart, was blind to the
change in Ivor's face.
</p>

<p>
"To be married to the Mishteer!  Gwladys,
who had filled his thoughts and heart for so
long&mdash;yes, ever since he could remember!"  And the
whole universe was shattered, as far as Ivor Parry
was concerned; but he sat still and made no sign,
for always the most agonising points of life are
the most silent.  When at last the bitter tale was
all told he rose slowly.
</p>

<p>
"There's news I've given thee," said Nani,
stopping for breath.
</p>

<p>
"News, indeed!" said Ivor; "but I must go.
Well, 'wish her joy' for me, Nani," and out
again to the June evening Ivor went, bruised,
wounded, bleeding, but fighting bravely with his
sorrow, and sustained by his pride.  Not for
worlds would he&mdash;Ivor Parry, the cheeriest and
bravest bachgen in the village&mdash;let it be seen
that he was sorely wounded; and he resumed
his old attitude with his thumbs in his armholes,
and struck up another verse of his disconnected
ballad, though how he managed it he never
afterwards could understand.  With head erect, and
with many improvised turns and grace notes, he
sang, as he went his way down the road:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O gwae fi, and woe is me!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my heart is full of pain;<br />
  For the ship that sailed across the sea<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Will never come back again!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On reaching his lodgings he was even more
lively than usual, making his cousin laugh at his
merry sallies, and hearing his own voice as if it
had been a stranger's.  He even made a show of
enjoying his tea; but after it was over he went
out, and, leaving the sail-shed behind him, turned
his face towards the cliffs.  Slipping down
through the broom bushes, he made his way by
an unfrequented sheep path to the beach below,
and, crossing the shore, reached the south end
of the harbour.  The turmoil of thoughts within
him seemed to urge him forwards, and every
step he took strengthened the only determination
he could evolve out of the chaos of misery in his
heart.  He must see Gwladys, must hear his
doom from her own lips!  The south end of the
shore was less frequented than the other.  The
crags were higher and more frowning here, the
shadows were deeper, the sands were seldom
trodden, and the sea seldom ruffled by oar or
sail; but here in the deep shadows the laver weed
grew thickest, and here Gwladys might come to
fill her creel as usual, "unless, indeed," thought
Ivor, "she might to-night be roaming over the
cliffs with Hugh Morgan, and so forget her creel
and Nance Owen."  The thought was so bitter
that he groaned aloud.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys had returned home a few minutes
after he had left the house, even soon enough to
hear an echo of his voice as he trolled out the
well-known ballad.  Her mother met her with a
happy, smiling face.
</p>

<p>
"Merch f√¢ch i!" she said, as she drew the
back of her fingers caressingly over the girl's
cheek, where the rich colour had paled a little.
Her heart was full of gratitude to the daughter
whose marriage promised to bring so much comfort
and freedom from care into her life.  "Ivor
Parry has been here to 'wish thee joy,'" she said;
and Gwladys' heart throbbed painfully.
</p>

<p>
"There's a merry man he is," continued Nani,
as she clattered the tea-cups on the little round
table; "singing he was when he came in, and
singing again when he went out."
</p>

<p>
In the gloom of the cottage she had not
noticed the pallor that overspread his face upon
receiving her news, neither did she now notice
her daughter's preoccupied silence.  It was very
evident that her elation of spirits had for the
time smothered Nani's usual tender thoughtfulness
for others.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I thought 'twas his voice," said
Gwladys at last.  "What did he say, mother?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, he was very glad.  'There's good
news, indeed!' sez he, and 'wish her joy for me,
Nani.'  Hast settled which stripe thee'lt have
in thy petticoat, lass?  What did Mari Vone
say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she liked best the blue.  I don't care
which; you can settle it, mother."
</p>

<p>
"Don't care!" said Nani, raising her hands
in astonishment.  "Well, in my deed, thou art
an odd girl in some things!  Going to be
married to the Mishteer, and not care whether thy
stripes are to be red or blue!  If it had been to
a common man like Dye Pentraeth or Ivor
Parry, it would be no 'otts' perhaps&mdash;but to the
Mishteer, the owner of half the village, so rich,
and so handsome, and with his achan[<a id="chap05fn2text"></a><a href="#chap05fn2">2</a>] going
back I don't know where!  A scarlet stripe it
shall be, then; and I wish there was a brighter
colour!" and she whisked the crock of "mash,"
which she was warming for her ailing cow, off
its hook over the fire with such a swing of
triumph that some of its contents was spilt on the
hearth, and Gwladys looked after her with a
smile, half-sad, half-amused.
</p>

<p>
"Mother f√¢ch,[<a id="chap05fn3text"></a><a href="#chap05fn3">3</a>] I have made her life happy,
whatever!" she said, and standing there in the
twilight, with the skeins of bright wool hanging
from her unconscious fingers, she fell into a
deep reverie.  "Is this how every girl feels when
she is going to be married?" and then a silence.
"Wish her joy for me!"  Well, what more
could she expect from any man who heard of her
approaching marriage?  The curves of the
mobile mouth fell, and the brown eyes became
suffused with tears.  Both signs of sadness,
however, were chased away as she heard a manly
footstep at the door, and Hugh Morgan entered
the cottage.  At the same moment Nani returned
from the cowshed, so, according to Welsh
custom, Hugh's manner was jovial and friendly
only, nothing warmer being considered decorous
in the presence of a third person, more especially
that of a future mother-in-law.
</p>

<p>
"Well, are you here, little people?  Coming
in from the sunset, I can't see you yet."
</p>

<p>
"We are here all right, Mishteer, and glad
to see you.  Come in," said Nani, as she dusted
a chair with her apron.
</p>

<p>
"I just came in to say I am going to Abersethin
to-night on business, so I sha'n't be able
to bring the new glee to show thee, Gwladys.
How does the world go with thee to-night,
Nani?"
</p>

<p>
"Right well, Mishteer.  Sit down, sit down."
</p>

<p>
"I must not stay long," said Hugh, and
Nani considerately made her sick cow an excuse
for pottering in and out of the house.  She
remembered the old saying, "I had better go,"
said the crow, "when the dove begins to coo!"  When
she had left the house, Hugh's manner
changed at once.
</p>

<p>
"How is my darling?" he said, taking the
listless fingers which held the red and blue
skeins; "and what are these pretty things?
Aha! now I'll warrant they are for some new
clothes for thy wedding," and he drew the
blushing girl towards him.  "The old sail-shed is
dull without thee, lass.  When will my wild
sea-bird get over her shyness?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm coming to-morrow, whatever,
Mishteer," said Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"Halt, halt!" said Hugh, laughing; "you
must drop that word now.  Mishteer, indeed!
Remember I will fine thee a kiss for every time
thou call'st me that!"
</p>

<p>
"I will try, indeed; but 'twill be hard at
first."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I won't be very angry if thou fail'st to
remember sometimes," answered Hugh, and, as
Nani's shadow darkened the door again, he
returned to his less warm, but still cordial,
manner, and soon rose to go.
</p>

<p>
"Nos da to you both!" he said, and, with a
loving look towards Gwladys, which he was
careful Nani should not see, he left the house.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ivor had waited on the darkened
shore until the sun had long set, and the moon,
now at her full, looked down upon the
shimmering bay.
</p>

<p>
The tide had turned, and still Gwladys had
not come; and while he waited there in the
shadow of the cliff, he pondered bitterly on
Nani's words, and sought in vain for any loophole
for hope that the news was not true, and that
he should yet find Gwladys free and unfettered.
</p>

<p>
"Fool! fool!" he said; "to think I could
safely loiter on the path of love! to see the
answer to my own heart gradually coming into
those brown eyes!  That's what I waited for;
but caton pawb! how could I expect such
happiness?  I have never seen a sign of that love
in her which fills my heart.  Sometimes,
indeed,"&mdash;and his troubled face took a tender,
faraway look&mdash;"sometimes I have seen her eyes
droop, and her blushes come when I have spoken
to her, and then I thought perhaps she cared
a little for me, for she is not like some
girls&mdash;Gwen or Ana, now.  'Twas not far to seek for
their smiles&mdash;no, nor their kisses either!  But
Gwladys!  I was afraid even to touch her, lest
she should fly away like a bird!" and he groaned
aloud in his trouble, and confessed to himself
that the darkest and direst misfortune that could
befall him was casting its shadow on his
path&mdash;nay, had already caught and overwhelmed
him.  Had his rival been anyone else, he could
have fought against his fate&mdash;yes, fought, and
perhaps conquered!  But the Mishteer! his
friend! his master! the man whom, of all others,
he held in such high esteem.  No!  the thought
was unbearable.  Life was not made to hold
such bitterness for him!  But, alas! life does
hold out to us sometimes a cup of so much
bitterness that imagination even would hesitate to
picture it as a possible event in our
experience.  We drink it to the dregs, and we
survive it.
</p>

<p>
A step on the pebbles, and Gwladys had at
last appeared, and Ivor watched her as she
picked her way between the boulders, unconscious
of his presence.  Oh, how lovely she looked,
her brown hair tossed by the soft night breeze,
the moon shining full upon the clear brown eyes,
and the coral of her lips! and what the
moonlight failed to reveal was only too plainly
pictured on his memory.  She held her two hands
on her bosom, grasping the strap of her creel,
and she rather bent her head over them as she
drew near.  She did not see Ivor until she was
close upon him, and for a moment stood
perfectly still.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys!" was all he could say at first,
and his voice was so altered, so hoarse, that she
stood up straight before him, and looked in
astonishment in his face, while she answered, in a
startled tone:
</p>

<p>
"Ivor Parry! it is thee, indeed?  Ach y fi!
I was not expecting to see thee; but I'm not
surprised, though, 'tis such a beautiful night."
</p>

<p>
Before she had finished speaking, Ivor had
regained his composure.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, 'tis a fine night," he said; "but 'twas
not that made me come out.  I have been at thy
mother's on my way home from Aberython, and
I&mdash;I&mdash;&mdash;" and he lifted his hat and pushed his
fingers through his hair, which was damp and
clammy.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," said Gwladys, beginning to
lose her own calmness.  "She gave me thy message.
I was not long after thee, for I heard thee
singing.  I thank thee for thy good wishes."
</p>

<p>
"I thought, perhaps, it was not true," said
Ivor, and his voice shook a little.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys was silent for a moment, during
which a flood of new emotions surged through
her whole being, so that her heart beat fast, her
limbs trembled, and the whole world seemed to
take a new shape before her.  Ivor's altered
manner, his hoarse voice, the nervous trembling of
the hands which he held out towards her, all
told the tale which he had withheld so long,
and, with a sudden flash of intuition which comes
in a great crisis, his love and misery were all
revealed to her; and alas! her love for him!  She
could not do otherwise than place her hands in
those which were stretched out so eagerly
towards her; but while she did so, her head
drooped, and her tears fell like rain.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis true," she said at last, "'tis true,
Ivor."
</p>

<p>
"Didst not know, Gwladys, that I loved
thee, that every hair of thine head was precious
to me?"
</p>

<p>
Many years passed over Ivor's head after that
night, but he never forgot the cry with which
she heard his words.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ivor! what is this thou art telling me?"
and sitting down on the upturned creel which
had slipped from her shoulders, she swayed
backwards and forwards, endeavouring to smother
the sobs which shook her frame.  In truth, it
was only the bursting of the floodgates, which
she had kept closed by a strong effort of will
ever since she had made her final promise to
Hugh Morgan.  The discovery of Ivor's love
had been too much for her overstrained nerves,
and now, with the abandon of a child, she sat
on her creel and cried bitterly.  Ivor seated
himself on a rock beside her, his worst fears
confirmed, and at last, when the sobbing girl had
a little regained composure, took her hand and
said:
</p>

<p>
"Didst not know that for long years I have
loved thee?&mdash;for ever, I think!"
</p>

<p>
"I did not know&mdash;no, indeed!" said the girl.
</p>

<p>
"If thou hadst known it, lass, what wouldst
thou have done?"
</p>

<p>
She did not answer at once, but continued to
rock herself backwards and forwards, and even
to moan a little.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me, Gwladys," Ivor said again; and at
last her answer came in clear, firm tones:
</p>

<p>
"Whatever thou wouldst, Ivor."
</p>

<p>
"Wouldst have married Hugh Morgan?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never, never!  But now I must.  Beth
na'i? beth na'i?"[<a id="chap05fn4text"></a><a href="#chap05fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
"No, no, lass, it must not be&mdash;shall not be!
I have hungered too much for thy love to let
it slip from me now.  'Tis not too late!  I will
go to Hugh Morgan and tell him all.  Thou
know'st him, Gwladys&mdash;a man who never did a
mean thing&mdash;a man who would tear out his
heart sooner than injure his friend!  I will go
to him, and tell him, 'Gwladys' love is mine&mdash;not
thine&mdash;and, by heaven! thou shalt not have
her!'"
</p>

<p>
His voice was hoarse with eagerness, and the
hand that held hers trembled with excitement.
</p>

<p>
But Gwladys only drew her hand away, and
said:
</p>

<p>
"'Tis too late, Ivor.  I have promised the
Mishteer, and our banns have been called once!"
</p>

<p>
At the mention of the word "banns," Ivor
made a gesture of despair.  Here, indeed, was
the downfall to all his reviving hopes&mdash;a bar
across his path only one degree less insuperable
than death itself&mdash;for though to a Welshman
scarcely any obstacle seems insurmountable,
scarcely any stratagem dishonourable in the
course of his impetuous love-making, yet marriage
and all connected with it holds the high
place in his reverence, which it seems to have
lost in many nations.
</p>

<p>
It is true that morality amongst the unmarried
peasantry lays itself open to reproach; but a
lapse from the paths of the strictest virtue after
marriage is always looked upon as an unpardonable
disgrace.
</p>

<p>
The knowledge, therefore, that Hugh Morgan's
banns were published crushed every hope
that had begun to spring up anew within Ivor's
breast.
</p>

<p>
"Mawredd anwl![<a id="chap05fn5text"></a><a href="#chap05fn5">5</a>] 'tis impossible!" he cried;
"so soon!  Gwladys, say it is not true, or thou
wilt kill me&mdash;an' 'tis the best thing thou canst do
for me, for now I see, indeed, that thou art gone
from me for ever!  Hugh Morgan has not
loitered, whatever!  Only one short week I was
away, and in that time another man has won
thee, and thy banns are out!"
</p>

<p>
She made no answer, but sat with her face
buried in her hands.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art crying, lass; is it pity for me?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she sobbed, "and&mdash;and for me!"
</p>

<p>
"Didst love me, then, all the time, f'anwylyd?
Tell me; I have a right to know."
</p>

<p>
He had drawn her close to his side, and she
felt his breath on her hair as he continued to
plead&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Say it, Gwladys&mdash;only once&mdash;only to-night!"
</p>

<p>
Poor Gwladys!  The glamour of the love
she had thirsted for was upon her in all its
fulness&mdash;was wrapping her in its folds.  Its strength
subdued her; she forgot her scruples, and stifled
the whispers of her usually tender conscience,
and, yielding to Ivor's pleadings and her own
impulsive, passionate nature, let her lover draw
from her the truth, which she had hitherto
scarcely confessed to herself.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;yes; I have loved thee always."
</p>

<p>
"And will love me for ever?&mdash;whisper it,
fanwylyd," said Ivor.
</p>

<p>
"No, I must not say that; but thou knowst
it all.  Oh! beth na'i, beth na'i?"
</p>

<p>
A step on the shingle disturbed them.
</p>

<p>
"Only Sianco fetching his crab-pots; but
here is my boat.  Let us go to Traeth-y-daran,
where the sand is never trodden; there we
shall be alone, for I tell thee, Gwladys, this night
is mine and thine&mdash;<i>nothing</i> shall tear it from us!"
</p>

<p>
He drew the boat to the side of the rock and
once again Gwladys and he were out together
on the moonlit bay.  It was so calm that nothing
could be heard but the creaking of the oars
in the rowlocks and the dripping of the water
from the blades.  Neither spoke until reaching
Traeth-y-daran, the boat glided in between the
rocks, and they landed on the shore which lay
lonely and peaceful in a flood of moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"Here is a seat for thee, love, and one for
me beside thee close.  Oh, yes; I said this
night was made for thee and me!  For a few
hours let us put everything else away from us,
Gwladys, and talk and think and feel nothing&mdash;nothing
but our love for each other.  I will
have it so!" he said almost fiercely.  "To-night
is for happiness&mdash;to-morrow is for&mdash;?.  Tell
me, lass, dost remember our last row on the
bay?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I have had it in my thoughts often,
and in my heart always," said Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"Hast indeed?" said Ivor; "didst feel my
kiss on thy hair?"
</p>

<p>
"I felt it," she answered, with head drooping
and burning cheeks; "but I did not think it
meant anything&mdash;indeed I didn't, Ivor!" and she
looked up pleadingly into his face.
</p>

<p>
"No, a fool I was!  I hid it all, thinking to
win thy love gradually and then to tell thee!
I thought I would guard thee so well that no
other man could approach thee unknown to me,
and then I would speak to thee at once.  Oh,
what a fool I was! and now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"And now?" repeated Gwladys tearfully; and
a silence fell upon them as they both thought of
"what might have been!"  Into the girl's dream
there came a shadow from the future&mdash;a picture
of Hugh Morgan bending over her as she sat
at work in his house on the hillside.  It was a
momentary glimpse and she shuddered as it
crossed her mind.
</p>

<p>
"Art cold, f'anwylyd?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," she answered; "on this May night
who would be cold?  I am warm, Ivor; 'tis the
future makes me shiver&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" he said, "don't speak about that;
there is no law in earth or heaven that can part
us, if only thou wilt let me go to Hugh Morgan
and ask him to free thee from thy promise&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"But the banns, Ivor?  Oh, no; 'tis impossible
to bring this shame upon the Mishteer's
name.  And my mother&mdash;she would break her
heart!  No, no; 'tis too plain we must part.
Will God give me strength, I wonder?  Beth
na'i? beth na'i?"
</p>

<p>
For some time Ivor, carried away by the
new-born happiness of knowing he had her love,
endeavoured to shake her determination; but here
she was firm, in spite of the weakness with which
she had allowed herself to be swayed by the
strong tide of love, which had overwhelmed
her on discovering Ivor's feelings towards her.
</p>

<p>
There were long pauses in their talk when the
sea seemed to add its sweet whispers of entreaty
to his pleading, until at last as the night wore on
there came a little pleading into Gwladys' voice
also&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Ivor, do not tempt me; I have done
wrong to come here, I ought to have said 'nos
da' and passed straight home&mdash;I am like the
seaweed, tossed hither and thither by the fierce
waves, but still fastened to the rock, and so
am I bound to the Mishteer.  Only that one
thing is certain in all this sea of trouble.  O
gwae fi! beth na'i?  Let me go, lad!  Thou
wouldst always help me when I was a child;
everywhere I was safe and strong, if thou wert
there.  And now, Ivor, help me, for the storm
is upon me!"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot, Gwladys&mdash;I cannot, indeed!  I
seek for the strength within me, and I do not
find it; but so far I can do, whatever&mdash;I will
stand out of thy way and let thee pass on to&mdash;the
Mishteer."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys, scarce knowing whether this made
her more or less miserable, but taking his words
somewhat in a literal meaning, began to move
a little towards the boat.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, stop, fanwylyd!" said Ivor, "not to-night
will I stand aside&mdash;not to-night will I part
with thee!  I have said, and I swear it again,
to-night thou art mine! and my fine promises do
not begin till to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
He drew her again closer to him&mdash;and again
they fell into a long silence.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys," said Ivor at last, "wilt tell me
what have thy thoughts been?"
</p>

<p>
"The same as thine, I do believe, Ivor," said
the girl, in a broken voice.  "Our happiness
would be to be together, but our duty bids us
part.  I cannot break my promise to the
Mishteer.  Our banns are called!  I am half
married to him!  I ought not to be here; I am a
wicked girl.  Why, why has he set his love upon
me?  I have promised to marry him, and I will
keep my word though my heart should break."
</p>

<p>
Ivor did not speak, he was struggling with a
trial which had come upon him unexpectedly
and unprepared for.  Every fibre of his being
was shaken by the shattering of his fondest
dreams&mdash;the love which he had cherished for
years, and for which he had built such fair
palaces of hope!  Was it now to be stifled and put
out of sight for ever? to be cast under the feet
of another man, who would walk over it with
joy and happiness on his face, unconscious of
the sacrifice which his friend was making for
him!
</p>

<p>
For some time they sat thus suffering together,
both brooding on the untoward events
which had separated them, and on the bitter
trial which lay before them.
</p>

<p>
It was Gwladys who spoke first.
</p>

<p>
"See how the moon has travelled, Ivor; she
is near her setting; the dawn is not far off.  Let
us go.  What will my mother think?"
</p>

<p>
"She will think thou art staying with Nance
Owen, as thou often hast before.  Dost see that
bright star?  We will wait until it sets!  So
short a time for happiness out of all our long
lives, Gwladys!"
</p>

<p>
"The good God will not grudge it us!" she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
"When that star sinks down behind the sea
I will loosen my hold of thee, fanwylyd; but
until then thou art mine&mdash;and mine only!  We
are alone in the world&mdash;two ships which have
sailed together half-way across the ocean, and
now must separate for ever!"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys' long-drawn sobs had subsided, and
left only a little catch in her breath, which Ivor
heard with yearning tenderness.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis hard for us both, love; but God grant
thee comfort as the years go by.  Thou wilt,
perhaps, gain peace, and learn to forget the
past."
</p>

<p>
"Never, never!" said the girl.  "Calm and
peace! where are they coming from, Ivor?  Oh,
never, never!"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a cruel thing, this life which is before
us, lass.  If I had known that Hugh had set his
love on thee, I might have strangled mine at its
birth, even though I had killed myself in doing
so; but now, 'tis too late, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"God knows about it, whatever," said
Gwladys between her sobs.
</p>

<p>
"Dost think, indeed!" was all Ivor's answer.
</p>

<p>
Both had their eyes fixed upon the star,
which hung like a jewel in the sky; it was
already losing some of its brilliancy in the haze
which bordered the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"See, Ivor, it is going!"  And she shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, fanwylyd!" he replied; and for a
few minutes they watched in silence as one
watches at a death-bed.
</p>

<p>
"Our happiness draws near its last moment,"
he said at last; and they both stood up together,
with their eyes fixed on the star, which now
drew close to the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Repeat those words, Gwladys, 'I love thee,
I love thee, Ivor!'"
</p>

<p>
And with whispering, trembling breath she
obeyed.
</p>

<p>
The star had reached the line of the sea; and,
with a simultaneous impulse, they turned to each
other, and their lips met in a long, passionate
kiss, and it was with a sudden gasp that Ivor
opened his arms, leaving Gwladys standing alone
on the edge of the wave.  He said not another
word, but drawing his boat higher up the
strand, he lifted her gently over the surf.  She
felt the nervous trembling of his strong arms
as he longed to press her to his heart; but he
resisted the impulse, and in another minute they
were both rowing silently away from the
Traeth-y-daran.
</p>

<p>
Before they reached Mwntseison Ivor spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Wilt land here?" he said, pointing to a
narrow creek between the cliffs, where a little
stream came trickling down from the hills above.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was all she could say in reply; and
once more Ivor lifted her over the surf, and
placed her on the tiny beach.  He sprang back
into his boat as if afraid to trust himself near her.
</p>

<p>
"Fforwel!" he said, in a hard, dry voice.
</p>

<p>
"Fforwel!" answered Gwladys.  And with
eyes fixed upon each other they separated, every
wave of the ebbing tide increasing the distance
between them.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Ivor had passed the point of
rocks which enclosed the little creek, he set to
with hard rowing to reach the further end of
the harbour, passing by Mwntseison still asleep.
His face was white and hard set, his hair hung
in damp clumps on his forehead, and as he rowed
his pale face wore an expression of sullen
anger,&mdash;in truth, an expression very foreign to his
general disposition.  Having reached the
southern side where the cliffs towered higher and
more frowning from the sea, where the fishing
boats never came, he was as much alone as if
he had been off some far desert island.  With an
angry motion he flung both the oars from him,
rattling noisily as they fell, and sitting moodily
in the stern he gave himself up to his bitter
reflections.  He did not feel the cool morning
breezes on his damp face, nor hear the lapping
of the water under the keel of his boat as it rose
and fell on the gentle swells; all so calm and
peaceful around him, and he so full of tumult
within!  It was just the hour between the dark
and the dawn; the sea was of the rough grey of
a herring's back, melting into the soft white of
the horizon.  The gurgle of the fish coming up
to the surface for a breath of air was distinctly
audible in the silence, and as the flush of the
dawn rose higher behind the hills, all sorts of
mysterious sounds awoke round the little boat.
The hoarse cry of an invisible puffin came over
the waters&mdash;a soft whispering of the morning
breeze filled the air, the strangely human cries
of the young seals which still haunt the caves
in the cliffs of Mwntseison, all fell unheeded on
Ivor's ear.  He was fighting with an emotion
which he had never known before&mdash;jealousy of
Hugh Morgan! a blind, unreasoning anger; and
underlying it, a desperate conviction that in the
end he should submit to his fate&mdash;for to fight
against the Mishteer was as impossible to him&mdash;as
contrary to his nature&mdash;as it would have been
to commit a crime!  And it was rebellion against
this iron destiny which filled his heart with
impotent anger.  From the moment when he had
caught the last glimpse of Gwladys standing
solitary on the shore of the creek, he had known
how it would be with him&mdash;how strong and
unbending were the bonds which compelled him
to give his best to his friend.
</p>

<p>
"As for her," he thought, "she would forget
him, would soon learn to be content with her
lot&mdash;yes, more than content&mdash;for no woman
could be loved by Hugh and not love him in
return!  That he never doubted; but for
himself?"  Self-sacrifice as an abstract idea had
never dawned upon him.  He was but an
untaught man, whose only education had been
what a tender nature and a simple country life
had brought him; but one thing was plain to
him, he must efface himself, and Hugh Morgan
must have his way!
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Gwladys remained motionless,
watching the little boat, until, a mere speck, it
rounded a ridge of rocks which jutted out into
the bay, and behind which lay Mwntseison; then
she dragged her weary steps up the steep cliff
from the shore, following a shepherd's path
through the broom and heather bushes, till she
reached the top of the hill, where she sat down
to watch the rising sun.  Behind her lay the
sea, with its soft sighings and tender whisperings,
the old world of her happiness and her youth&mdash;and
Ivor! before her lay the cold east, from
whose mysterious bosom the dawn was breaking,
and as she watched, the sun rose and tipped
each little blade and leaf with gold.  Here,
kneeling between the broom bushes, while the
morning breeze ruffled her hair, alone on the hillside,
she struggled in an agony of tears and supplications
to put away from her the memory of the
past night, with its golden moon of love and its
bitter waves of sorrow&mdash;and to turn her face
towards that path of duty which lay before her.
At another time how she would have delighted
in the sounds and sights around her! the
dewdrops glistening on the sea-pinks, the gossamer
webs stretched like frosted silver from bush to
bush, the rabbits peeping out of their burrows,
the shepherd awakening his flock, the sea-gulls
sailing high above the hill top, where the little
sea-crows were beginning the day with a
squabble; but it was all lost upon Gwladys, who
reached her mother's house while the village
was still sleeping under the early morning sun.
There was only the wooden bolt to push back,
and she knew the simple trick by which it was
reached from the outside.
</p>

<p>
"Why! thou hast risen early," said her
mother, as she saw her enter.  "What! is Nance
Owen up so early?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not been there!"
</p>

<p>
There was something in the girl's voice which
startled her mother.
</p>

<p>
"Where, then?" she cried, sitting up in bed.
</p>

<p>
"With Ivor Parry out on the bay!  Mother,
it will never happen again&mdash;we had something
to say to each other&mdash;it is passed&mdash;you must
forget it, mother, as I shall&mdash;but I wanted to
tell you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Her mother, breathless and frightened, stared
at the girl, who, pale and dry-eyed, began to set
about her household duties.  Whether she
understood what that "something" had been
which had been spoken at Traeth-y-daran, she
never disclosed; but she opened her arms and
drew Gwladys towards her, "Calon f√¢ch!"[<a id="chap05fn6text"></a><a href="#chap05fn6">6</a>] was
all she said as she pressed the girl to her heart.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
CHANGES.
</h3>

<p>
The work in the sail-shed went on as usual
in the following week&mdash;the same hum of voices,
the same chatter and laughter amongst the
women.  The only difference was that Ivor Parry
looked ill and worn.
</p>

<p>
"He had been out fishing one night," so ran
the story, "and returning in the early morning
had slipped as he jumped from his boat, and
falling on a slippery rock had had what 'n'wncwl
Jos called 'a nasty old shake.'  When asked
about it, he had treated it with indifference,
saying, 'I did slip and twisted my back a little; but,
caton pawb! what is that?'  And he had been
as busy as ever at his work, scoffing at any
suggestions of sympathy."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys, at the further end of the long shed,
worked quietly at her canvas, with drooping
eyelids and flushed cheeks.  She knew she was an
object of interest to those around her, and was
thankful to remember that no one knew
anything about her love for Ivor.  She heard the
comments upon his fall and his altered appearance
with a strange callousness which frightened
her.  Her heart was like a stone within her; she
never turned her eyes towards the other end of
the shed where the harder and heavier part of
the work was carried on by the men.  Fortunately
for her, it is not considered etiquette in
Wales for a lover to pay marked attentions to his
betrothed in public, so she was spared the pain
of conversing with Hugh in Ivor's presence,
except upon the ordinary topics connected with the
work.  But although Hugh adhered to the usual
fashion of ignoring his sweetheart's presence
before the curious eyes of the gossips, he yet held
his head more proudly than ever.  There was a
light in his eyes and a smile on his lips which
added a fresh charm to his handsome face; and
as he gave directions to his work-people, there
was a ring of happiness in his voice which
plainly told its own tale.  One thing troubled
him&mdash;Ivor was suffering!  Of that he was
sure.  And as it drew near closing time, he
spoke to his friend words of serious advice
and of kindly sympathy; for Hugh could be
as tender as a woman in spite of his burly
frame.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, 'mach-geni!"[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] he said, sitting
on a bale in front of Ivor; "this will never do.
Every hour thou art getting to look paler and
thinner; thou must stop in bed to-morrow, and
I'll send to Abersethin for Dr. Hughes.  I'm
afraid thou hast got more of a wrench than thou
knowest of."
</p>

<p>
"Not a bit," laughed Ivor; but his laugh had
not its usual light-heartedness.  "I know
exactly what the wrench was&mdash;it hurt a good deal;
but dost think I'm going to stop in bed and
send for a doctor?  I never did such a thing in
my life!  Twt, twt, 'twill be all right if thou
wilt let me alone, and not bother me about my
looks."
</p>

<p>
Hugh had never known him so irritable before,
and he looked at him critically as he left
him.
</p>

<p>
"Well, if thou won't listen to advice, I can't
help thee."
</p>

<p>
"What about that order for the Sea
Nymph?" Ivor called after him.
</p>

<p>
Hugh shook his head.  "I cannot take it,"
he said; "the time is too short.  Send them to
Rees of Carnarfon; it will be quite as convenient
for the owners, and more so for me," and
he returned slowly towards Ivor.  "I am going
to be married next week," he said; "come down
this evening, lad, and I'll tell thee all about it.
Thou must sprack up, and arrange some jollification
for the people.  We'll have two days'
holidays, and I'll leave all the fun in thine hands,
Ivor, only come to me for the money.  I know
I can trust thee to manage it all.  Dost hear,
man?  Why, what's the matter with thee?
Dr. Hughes shall see thee to-night, or my name's
not Hugh Morgan."
</p>

<p>
"'Twas only a wrench," said Ivor; "it's all
over, and I'll see to the bonfires and shooting."
</p>

<p>
"Right," said Hugh; but he shook his head
as he went away.
</p>

<p>
Later on in the evening, as Madlen was
preparing supper under the big open chimney in
the kitchen, a step disturbed her.
</p>

<p>
"Who's that?" she said snappishly, for the
uwd[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>] was at the point of boiling.  "Oh, Ivor
Parry!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," he answered, walking in unceremoniously.
"I wanted to see the Mishteer."
</p>

<p>
"Wel wyr! didst expect to see him here?
He is up with Gwladys Price, of course.
Howyer bach![<a id="chap06fn3text"></a><a href="#chap06fn3">3</a>]  There's going to be changes!  I
tell thee, Ivor Parry, he's perfectly mad about the
girl.  Wel, dwla dwl yw dwl h√™n!"[<a id="chap06fn4text"></a><a href="#chap06fn4">4</a>]
</p>

<p>
"Will he come to his supper?"
</p>

<p>
"Most likely not; not even potatoes and
buttermilk will bring him home now."
</p>

<p>
But her prognostications were false to-night,
for at that moment Hugh entered, bright and
breezy.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Ivor! just in time for supper,
'mach-geni; sit down.  Art better?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, all right," he said, sitting down to the
table, on which Madlen placed the smoking
"uwd" with a large jug of milk.  In every
other cottage in Mwntseison wooden bowls and
wooden spoons would have been used, but the
Mishteer's table was graced by blue-rimmed
basins and silver spoons.
</p>

<p>
"I wanted to see thee, Ivor; we've not had
a talk for some time."
</p>

<p>
"No, I have been too busy."
</p>

<p>
"And so have I, in my deed," said Hugh.
"What between the torn sails of the Albatross&mdash;the
new boat which is building for me&mdash;and
a few new things I am getting for my house&mdash;well,
the time has seemed to fly.  What dost
think of the new 'coffor' I have bought for
Gwladys?" and he opened with pride the doors
of a handsome oak wardrobe.  "The best piece
of work John 'Saer'[<a id="chap06fn5text"></a><a href="#chap06fn5">5</a>] has ever done, I think."  The
shelves inside were well filled with stores
of snowy napery, sheets, and table-cloths, etc.,
luxuries little known in Mwntseison.  "And
these drawers at the bottom to keep her clothes!
Mari Vone has seen to it all for me."
</p>

<p>
"A splendid coffor, indeed," said Ivor; "and
John Saer knew who he was working for, I
think."  But then he added a most irrelevant
remark, "Poor Mari Vone!"
</p>

<p>
"What dost mean by that?" said Hugh,
flushing a dark red.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing," said Ivor.  "I was only
thinking how dull it must be for her to arrange
the household for another girl."
</p>

<p>
"Dull!" said Hugh earnestly, and with a
momentary sadness in his voice.  "Thou art
mistaken, Ivor.  Mari Vone knows not what
dullness means.  She would laugh to hear thy
words."
</p>

<p>
"When art going to be married?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, on Tuesday," said Hugh; "of course
I expect thee to be my teilwr.  Pretty Gwennie
Hughes and Laissabeth Owen are to be bridesmaids."
</p>

<p>
"That is what I came down to speak about,"
said Ivor.  "I thought very likely thou wouldst
want me to be teilwr."
</p>

<p>
"Of course! who else?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'm afraid I cannot be that," said
Ivor awkwardly, digging his hands in his pockets.
"See this letter, and say if thou thinkest I
ought to refuse so good an offer."
</p>

<p>
Hugh took the letter with a look of serious
surprise, and read it without comment from
beginning to end; then he folded it up deliberately,
and returned it to Ivor, looking him full in the
face, and before his honest eyes Ivor's quailed
and were cast down.
</p>

<p>
"Thou wilt better thyself very much by
accepting their offer; but I never thought thou
wouldst leave me, Ivor.  I would have given
thee as much as that had I known thou wert
looking for it.  I have, perhaps, been slow in
rewarding thy merit; but, Ivor, I looked upon thee
as a brother, and I meant only to wait until my
wedding was over to offer to take thee into
partnership, but now&mdash;go!  I have been mistaken in
thee; I never thought money would come between
us.  Even now&mdash;stay, Ivor, and I will give
thee what Rees Carnarfon offers thee."
</p>

<p>
Ivor shook his head.  "I have determined to
go," was all he answered.
</p>

<p>
Hugh was wounded to the quick.  He had a
deep love for his manager&mdash;a love that had
grown up for years between them, in spite of
the difference in their ages&mdash;and to find that
parting had no bitterness for Ivor meant bitter
sorrow for Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Then there's no more to be said, but pay
what I owe thee," and he counted it out on the
table.
</p>

<p>
Ivor gathered it stolidly into his palm, and
took up his hat.
</p>

<p>
"Fforwel, Mishteer," he said, "we must part
now; your life is full&mdash;you can do without me.
There is Josh Howels, he is quite able to take
my place; he knows all the ins and outs of the
business," continued Ivor.
</p>

<p>
Hugh nodded.  "Oh, yes, I can do without
you," he said, in an offended tone.
</p>

<p>
"Fforwel, then," said Ivor, and he held out
his hand, which Hugh, after a moment's
hesitation, grasped warmly.  "If you are ever in
any trouble, send for me, Mishteer, and I will
come."
</p>

<p>
Again they said "Fforwel," and parted&mdash;Hugh
Morgan with a feeling of burning indignation
and a smarting sense of disappointment;
Ivor with a dull, heavy aching, which he was
not to throw off for many a weary month.
</p>

<p>
"Let him think me ungrateful and grasping,"
he said; "it is better for him than to know the
truth.  Fforwel, Hugh Morgan, I shall never
meet a man like you again!"
</p>

<p>
Indignation and sorrow were the feelings
uppermost in Hugh's mind as he sat smoking on
his lonely hearth that evening.  Madlen had
gone to bed, and he sat long into the night,
gazing into the dying embers of the peat fire,
"chewing the cud of sweet and bitter thought."  The
announcement of Ivor's intended departure
was a crushing blow to him.  He had loved the
man with all the tenderness which in his lonely
life had had no other outlet until Gwladys Price's
beauty had enslaved him; and even this had not
altered his feelings for his friend, but had rather
drawn him nearer to him.  Mari Vone and Ivor
had been his ideals of all that was manly and
womanly, and his affections had gone out to
them unstintingly; and now he would have been
ashamed that any one should see how deeply he
felt the change in Ivor&mdash;in truth, his bright,
black eyes were dimmed with unshed tears as
he knocked the ashes out of his pipe, and,
slipping the wooden bolt of the front door into its
hasp, walked slowly up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
The next day Ivor was absent from the sail-shed.
Such a thing had never happened before,
excepting when he had been attending to business
for the Mishteer; but now everybody knew
this was not the cause, and gossip, with its busy
tongue, suggested all sorts of reasons&mdash;all of
them, fortunately, very wide of the mark.  "He
had injured his back too much to continue
working," one said.  "The increased wages offered
by Rees Carnarfon had dazzled him."  "He was
tired of Mwntseison, and thought this would be
a good opportunity for making a move," etc., etc.
</p>

<p>
"What can it mean?" said a girl to Gwladys,
as she entered the sail-shed in the morning.
"What can have come to Ivor?  Have you
any idea?"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys shook her head, and would not trust
her voice to speak.
</p>

<p>
"I'll tell you what they say," said the girl,
"that he is jealous of you."
</p>

<p>
They were already beginning to drop the
familiar "thee" and "thou" in addressing
Gwladys.  She noticed the omission, and blushed
a vivid red.
</p>

<p>
"There!" said her friend, holding up her
hands in admiration, "there's the colour we've
been used to see in your face; in my deed, you
are not like yourself lately.  Twt, twt, it is not
such a wonderful thing to be married that you
need grow thin and pale about it.  'That will
be the end of us all,' as the old maid said when
she watched the wedding.  There! look at her
now, Mishteer!"  And Hugh, who was just entering,
gazed with admiration at Gwladys' blushing face.
</p>

<p>
"Thou hast brought back her roses, indeed,
Malen," he said, smiling.  "What hast been
saying to her?"
</p>

<p>
"We were talking about Ivor Parry, and I
tell her it is jealousy of her that has made him
leave."
</p>

<p>
"Was that possible?" thought Hugh, as he
turned away.  "Was it the jealousy of love that
had caused Ivor's strange behaviour?" and
somehow the thought brought comfort to him;
the loss of his friend did not weigh quite so
heavily upon him.  "He would get over this
foolish feeling; he would return to Mwntseison
again, and to his work in the sail-shed, and the
same happy relations would exist between them
as had of old."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys had retired to her old corner.  The
sail had already been spread in a convenient
position for working, her stool placed before it,
and she knew well whose tender care had
arranged her work for her.  She looked over to
where Hugh Morgan was standing, stalwart and
strong, as if he were going to address his work-people,
and a wan little smile flitted over her face,
where the rich colour was already ebbing.
</p>

<p>
Hugh caught the smile, and his heart beat
fast, for, though he hid his feelings from the eyes
of the crowd, as was his bounden duty to do if
he did not wish to brush the bloom off the peach,
to rob his love of the romance of a real Welsh
courtship, still his thoughts were ever hovering
round Gwladys.  Be it remembered that, though
he was past the intoxication of "love's young
dream," he had succumbed to the passion which
had assailed him with all the strong fervour
belonging to middle age.  His heart had been so
long steeled against the glamour of love that
now at last, when it had made a breach in his
walls, he had completely surrendered to its mad
enthralment.  His fervid words, the passionate
ardour of his looks and his embraces, fell upon
Gwladys' soul with scorching pain; she could
not feel the same love for him, and, therefore,
wearied of its intensity.  She reproached herself
incessantly with coldness and want of feeling,
and endeavoured by occasional warmth of manner
to make up for the ordinary want of interest.
</p>

<p>
"I will love him when we are married, and,
God helping me, I will be a good wife to him."  This
was the continual burden of her thoughts;
her life was one constant struggle to banish from
her mind the memory of Ivor, and, though his
image ran like an under-current through the
stream of her existence, she yet managed to keep
all conscious thoughts of him in abeyance.
"What was to come of it all?  What was going
to happen to smooth out the tangled path into
which her feet had so unintentionally strayed?
God knows!  I can only trust, and try to be a
good wife."
</p>

<p>
While these thoughts passed through her
mind, Hugh was speaking, and the work-people
had dropped their tools, and were listening with
attention.
</p>

<p>
"You know, my friends," he said, "that a
great sorrow has fallen upon me in the loss of
my right-hand man, Ivor Parry.  His reasons
for going are good ones.  He has been offered
a post of great responsibility, bringing with it
an increased salary.  It is every man's duty to
make his way in the world if he can, and however
much we may regret his loss here, I know
that there is not one of you, man, woman, or
child, who does not send with him to-day a
greeting of love, and an earnest hope that his
path may be blessed with every good which can
fall to man in this world.  Josh Howels will take
his place as my manager, and I expect from you
the same obedience and deference to him, and
to my orders through him, as you have always
shown to Ivor Parry."
</p>

<p>
Josh Howels rose to say a few words in
answer.  Gwladys leant back against the boarded
wall of the shed, her head leaning on a rough
shelf, her eyes fixed on the sky and sea, which
were visible through the wide open doors.  She
saw the sea-gulls sailing in the air; she heard
the hoarse cry of the puffins, which crowded the
cliffs above Traeth-y-daran; and the picture of a
moonlit beach, on which sat two figures close
together, arose before her mental vision; but, with
a spasm of pain, she literally shrank from the
picture, and by a strong effort of will banished
it from her mind.
</p>

<p>
In a few days the eventful week had dawned
which she had dreaded, and yet longed for of
late!  Surely this dull aching would cease! surely
this sharp agony of thwarted desires would
be quenched when once she was Hugh Morgan's
wife!  Here lay her only hope&mdash;and to this
hope she clung with the frantic energy of a
drowning man.  Her mother had finished all her
simple preparations for the wedding, which was
to bring such honour and lustre upon them;
she had forced herself to forget that pale dawn
when Gwladys had entered the house like a spirit
or unrest.  Sometimes when she heard of Ivor's
intended departure from the village, or when she
saw Gwladys' paling cheek, a throb of disquietude
would pierce her heart; but Hugh Morgan's
tenderness, his absolute devotion to her
daughter re-assured her.
</p>

<p>
"She must love him," she thought; "no
woman could help it!  She will be a happy girl,
and I shall be a happy mother-in-law!"
</p>

<p>
Indeed, in the whole village congratulations
for Nani and Gwladys were rife, and "There's
a fortunate girl!" was the refrain of every
conversation upon the subject of the Mishteer's
marriage.  One alone was dissatisfied&mdash;Mari Vone!
And as she sat in the gloaming on the eve of
the wedding-day, her thoughts were evidently
none of the happiest; her fair golden head
drooped a little over her shining knitting needles,
her graceful tall figure had a listless curve in it
as she sat looking out of the open doorway; she
heard a footstep on the road which she recognised
at once.  "He is going to Gwladys!" she
thought, and she patiently clasped her hands
upon her bosom, as if to quiet the throbbing
heart within; but no! the steps drew near, and
against the red sunset the figure of Hugh
Morgan loomed clear and large.  He nodded
pleasantly over his pipe, and Mari pushed a rush
stool nearer the door for him to sit upon.
</p>

<p>
"That will do!" he said; "the smoke will
blow out to the road."  And with a long-drawn
"Ah!" of satisfaction, he stretched out his legs,
and gave himself up to the enjoyment of his
pipe for a time, during which Mari plied him
with questions, most of which he answered with
a nod or shake of the head.
</p>

<p>
"Hast Madlen finished her baking? and
roasted her chickens?  The lobster and crab I
have boiled myself.  Gwladys will be glad of a
dainty supper, for she will be very tired.  It is
well for her that she is marrying a man who can
afford to give her dainties, for her mother tells
me she has a poor appetite lately, and turns
away from the barley bread."
</p>

<p>
"God bless her! she shall have white bread,
white as a dog's tooth! and anything else she
may fancy," said Hugh, and he puffed away in
silence a little longer.
</p>

<p>
"You are sure to be at the wedding, Mari?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I am coming," she answered quietly.
</p>

<p>
"It gave me a terrible fright when somebody
said you were not coming&mdash;you and Ivor away.
I should have felt it a bad omen, Mari."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, twt, twt! nonsense about bad omens!
If I had stopped away it would only have been
because I am getting too old for weddings, and
biddings, and fairs.  I leave that to the young
girls now."
</p>

<p>
Hugh laughed sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
"You know better than that, Mar.  You
know very well that whenever you appear the
girls have all to hide their heads.  They are none
of them fit to hold a candle to you.  What old
age may make of you I don't know; but sure I
am, no creature that treads God's earth graces it
more than you do!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! there's pretty words, whatever, Hugh,"
said Mari, dropping her knitting on her lap, and
letting her hands fall with it, and gazing out
rather sadly over Hugh's shoulder to the
glowing sea and sky beyond.
</p>

<p>
"You are going to see Gwladys to-night, of
course?  She will be expecting you."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh; "I am going now&mdash;but&mdash;but
Mari, I felt I wanted to say something before
I went.  We have been friends for years&mdash;we
shall be friends still&mdash;eh?" and he held out
his broad brown hand.
</p>

<p>
Mari placed her own in it.
</p>

<p>
"Friends forever, Hugh, as long as life shall
last!"
</p>

<p>
"And after," he said.  "Well, fforwel, and
God bless you!" and Hugh made his way under
the wreaths and banners which already spanned
the road, in readiness for next day's festivities,
leaving Mari to her thoughts and to her
knitting, upon which by and by a large tear
fell.
</p>

<p>
"Hoi! hoi! stop a bit!" said 'n'wncwl Jos,
whom Hugh met stumping down the road.
"Don't go under the banners before the wedding.
It brings bad luck, man."
</p>

<p>
"It's too late," answered Hugh jovially, "for
I have been under two or three," and his beaming
smile and sparkling eyes, as he turned up
the path towards Gwladys' cottage, showed that
whatever the future had in store for him,
to-night he was well content.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
A WEDDING CALL.
</h3>

<p>
The month of May, with all her charms on
earth, sea, and sky, had slipped away, and June
reigned in her place, pouring forth her stores of
bud and blossom, laying her warm hand on the
ripening fruit in the orchards, turning their
cheeks to crimson and gold, lulling the waves to
rest, and folding the young broods of birds,
which swarmed in the cliffs, in her mantle of soft
balmy air.  The shepherd's song was heard from
the hillside as he sat basking in the sunshine, the
clap, clap of the mill came on the breeze, the
clinking of the village anvil, the voices of little
children, all blended together in delicious
harmony.  Every door and window in the village
was open, and the air was filled with the "sh-sh"
of the sea.  The children sat playing on the
warm, dry sand.  'N'wncwl Jos sat astride on the
keel of his boat, which had been turned upside
down for repairs.  He had a pot of tar and some
tow beside him, but the work did not proceed
very rapidly, as The Ship Inn was so near, and
the heat of the sun made an occasional "blue"
a necessity.  'N'wncwl Jos's time was a commodity
that hung heavily on his hands, and there
was no hurry to get the boat done, so he
exchanged his quid of tobacco from one cheek to
another, and took his daily snooze in the June
sunshine.  Suddenly a gentle voice aroused him.
</p>

<p>
"'N'wncwl Jos!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, merch i?"[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>] and he began busily to
caulk a crack in his boat.
</p>

<p>
It was Gwladys who stood beside him, rather
paler, perhaps, than when he saw her last, but
with the same sweet curves over mouth and
chin&mdash;with the same serious look in the brown
eyes&mdash;which were shaded by the white sun-bonnet.
</p>

<p>
"Wilt come and help me with the brewing
this afternoon?" she said, with a languid tone in
her voice, which, perhaps, was due to the heat.
</p>

<p>
"B'd siwr! b'd siwr!"[<a id="chap07fn2text"></a><a href="#chap07fn2">2</a>] replied the old man,
waking up with evident interest.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh says thou hast the secret for making
the beer clear."
</p>

<p>
"So I have, merch i&mdash;learnt it from my
grandmother.  How far hast thou got with thy
brewing?"
</p>

<p>
"The brecci is working," she said, "but I'm
afraid it won't be clear.  I have never brewed
before."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be up this afternoon," said 'n'wncwl Jos,
"and we shall see whether thine ale will be clear
or not.  The Mishteer knew where to send thee
for advice!  Have you heard the news?"
</p>

<p>
"What news?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that Ivor Parry is very ill; there he
lies stranded at Carnarvon, poor fellow, in some
strange lodging, laid up with fever.  The
Lapwing arrived at Abersethin last night from
Carnarvon with slates, and brought the news.  I
thought he was sickening for something before
he left; didst notice how white he looked?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Gwladys, looking across the bay,
where in the distance the line of the
Carnarvonshire hills looked like a chain of blue
clouds.
</p>

<p>
"The Mishteer will be shockin' sorry to hear
it," said the old man, shaking his head.  "I'm
going to the sail-shed to tell him as soon as I
have finished this job."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys turned silently away, her heart like
a lump of lead, her eyes burning with tears which
she must not shed.  She must not even ask for
more particulars&mdash;nay, she must not even wish
for more; and as she walked back over the dusty
road to her new home, she tightened her grasp
upon her own feelings, and laid a strong curb
upon her natural instincts.
</p>

<p>
She followed the progress of the brewing with
punctilious care, patiently and gently directing
Madlen, who endeavoured to frustrate all the
plans of the new mistress with the annoying
obstinacy of a jibbing horse.  She peeped into the
mash-tub, and exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Sure as I'm here, it'll never clear; it's as
thick as the Gwendraeth after rain!"
</p>

<p>
Getting no reply she tried in another direction:
</p>

<p>
"Ivor Parry and Mishteer always praised my
ale; 'twas as clear as cryshal,[<a id="chap07fn3text"></a><a href="#chap07fn3">3</a>] but cawl it'll be
to-day!"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys smiled.  "Thee's an evil prophetess,
Madlen!"
</p>

<p>
They both looked up as a shadow fell through
the open doorway.  It was Gwen.
</p>

<p>
"I came to ask thee if I could help in the
brewing.  Thee'lt like be anxious about thy first
brewing; how does it go?"
</p>

<p>
"Pretty well, I think," said Gwladys.  "It
will be casked to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Have you heard of Ivor's illness?" said
Gwen, looking full into her face, which visibly
blanched under her keen glance.
</p>

<p>
"'N'wncwl Jos has just been telling me," said
her victim, trying in vain to speak in a natural
tone.  "What is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Fever, they say," said Gwen, "but a bad
one.  Siencyn saw him in his lodgings; 'tis a
good thing he is well looked after.  The daughter
of the house seems very fond of him, and he of
her, for he calls her continually, 'Gwladys!
Gwladys!' if she only leaves him for a minute.
Dir anwl![<a id="chap07fn4text"></a><a href="#chap07fn4">4</a>] how pale thou art getting!  Art not
well?"
</p>

<p>
"Not very," said Gwladys.  "The heat has
been so great to-day, and the wind blows straight
from the limekilns."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, indeed! but thou hast lost thy
roses whatever!" and lifting the lid of the
mash-tub, she peered into its contents.  "There's a
muddy cloud in it!  That will spoil thy brewing."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, indeed!" said Gwladys, using the
formula that does duty in Wales for every
variety of expression.
</p>

<p>
"What will the Mishteer say?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, he won't mind much if I do not
grieve about it."
</p>

<p>
"No; I suppose thou canst do pretty well
what thou lik'st with him now.  So can I with
Siencyn; but that won't last.  'There's never a
pig' thee knowest, 'without a twist in his tail,'
and 'never a man without a quirk in his
temper!'  Oh! yes, we shall see it some day; but as
long as we have nothing to <i>hide</i> we need fear
nothing.  But diwedd anwl![<a id="chap07fn5text"></a><a href="#chap07fn5">5</a>] the time goes like
the andras.[<a id="chap07fn6text"></a><a href="#chap07fn6">6</a>]  I must go.  Pity for Ivor Parry&mdash;isn't it?"
</p>

<p>
When she was gone, Gwladys began to
breathe again, and endeavoured to steel herself
against the wounds which she would receive in
her passage through life, and to endure, for this,
she felt, would be her portion for the future.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys!" called a manly voice, and Hugh
entered from the sunshine, "where art, my little
one?  Come and comfort me, for I have had bad
news, and thou wilt be sorry, too!  Poor Ivor is
ill; hast heard?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she said; "Gwen has just been telling
me; but he has a good nurse, and we must not
look on the dark side."
</p>

<p>
"No, true, merch i; but I'd give much to
have him back here again&mdash;foolish boy!  I
believe he was jealous of my love for thee!
Siencyn Owen says he was quite delirious; called
constantly for the girl who nurses him, 'Gwladys,
Gwladys!' sometimes in such pitiful tones that
Siencyn felt like crying; and talking, talking
without stopping about the sea and the moon and
the stars!  'Gwladys,' he said, 'our star is
sinking&mdash;sinking&mdash;sinking!'  Oh, 'tis pity, indeed,
we can't have him here to nurse him&mdash;thy gentle
ways and thy tender care would bring him round,
Gwladys; but what is the matter, lass?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a pain!" said the girl, laying her hand
on her bosom.  "A sharp pain, a real pain!  I
have had it before to-day; I think it must be the
brecci, which I have tasted too often."  And a
pitiful little smile crossed her face.
</p>

<p>
Hugh was all anxiety and fright, and not
without cause, for Gwladys had quietly slipped
to the ground in a dead faint.
</p>

<p>
In a moment, Madlen the contumacious had
forgotten her pique, and was rushing about in
search of the inevitable "drop of brandy," while
Hugh lifted his wife from the ground, and placed
her on the settle, where she presently regained
consciousness.  His tender words of love were
the first that reached her ears.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys, f√¢ch! my little girl! dear heart! open
thine eyes.  Art better, darling?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said the girl, reaching both hands
towards him, and bursting into tears.  "Hugh,
Hugh, you have married a foolish, weak girl;
but have patience with me, and I will get wiser
and better."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, ho! as for that," said Hugh, tenderly
drawing her towards him, "I want no change
in thee!"
</p>

<p>
After the never-failing restorative of a cup of
tea, Gwladys revived, and Hugh was happy again;
and when 'n'wncwl Jos arrived in the afternoon,
Hugh left him with Gwladys to the mysteries of
casking the beer, his wooden leg stumping up
and down incessantly from the beer-cellar to the
living-room.  He placed some mysterious object
on the table, wrapped up in paper, refusing to
unfold it until the last moment.
</p>

<p>
"Now," he said, when the casks had been
placed in position, and everything prepared for
pouring in the brecci, "now, then, Mishtress, let's
see if your brewing won't be the clearest in
Mwntseison."
</p>

<p>
"Gwen said there was a cloud in it this morning!"
</p>

<p>
"Gwen!" he said, with a start.  "She hasn't
been looking at it, has she?"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Ach y fi! there's a pity!  She is too nearly
related to Peggi Sh√¢n for her eyes or her fingers
to do any good to thy brewing.  I remember
once, when my mother was brewing (and she
was famed for her clear cwrw), but j√¢r-i!  Peggi
Sh√¢n came to the door; 'twas a very sunny day,
and her shadow fell straight over the mash-tub,
and, sure as I'm here, the beer was as thick as
bwdran![<a id="chap07fn7text"></a><a href="#chap07fn7">7</a>]  Always after that we kept the door
locked on brewing days."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps, indeed!" said Gwladys!  "I will do
so next time, for there is something about Gwen
I don't like."
</p>

<p>
"Well, we've got nothing to do but try our
best now; but 'tis pity Gwen looked at it!"  And
he unfolded from the crumpled newspaper a large
lump of coal, which, after well washing, he placed
at the bottom of the cask, pouring the fermented
brecci gently over it.  "There it is!  Now all I
ask for my secret is&mdash;that when your cask is
empty, you will take the coal out, and burn it in
the middle of your strongest fire; it will bring
good luck to your next brewing; you will be
surprised to see what a mass of mud will be
gathered round it, and your beer will be like the
cryshal! and I'll come and taste the first glass."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, thou shalt indeed!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-bye, Mishtress; 'tis only Gwen I
am afraid of now!  Hast heard any more about
Ivor Parry?"
</p>

<p>
"No," answered Gwladys, in a calm voice
which astonished herself, "only that he is well
nursed by the daughter of the house&mdash;Gwladys
is her name!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, poor fellow! when you are ill it
is well to have a woman about you," and he
stumped away.
</p>

<p>
Quite in the gloaming, when the hearth had
been swept up, Gwladys, dressed in her neatest
frock of Welsh flannel, with her favourite pink
muslin kerchief tied loosely round her neck, sat
knitting near the little window, through which
the setting sun sent a rosy parting glow.
</p>

<p>
Hugh had gone a few miles into the country
on business, and Nell Jones and Sara Pentraeth,
two near neighbours, had taken the opportunity
of paying their first wedding call upon the bride.
They were constant friends and companions, and
although they quarrelled at almost every
interview, never seemed happy apart.  They had
heard so much of the glories of Gwladys' new
home that they had been dying to see it for the
last fortnight, but had been unable hitherto to
overcome their jealousy sufficiently to pay the
requisite visit; this evening, however, they both
made their appearance in the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Dir anwl! is it you, Nell f√¢ch? and you,
Sara, venturing to leave your little baby? there's
kind you are," and Gwladys dusted too already
speckless chairs and placed them for her guests.
</p>

<p>
"Well, we have come to wish you 'Priodas
dda,' Mishtress," said Sara, who was spokeswoman,
Nell being too busily engaged with roving
eyes in taking stock of the furniture; "and
we would have come before, but as for me,
indeed, to goodness, my heart sank down to my
clocs, when I heard of all the grand things around
you; but I am glad now I came, for I am not so
frightened after all, and I don't see anything out
of the way here!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope not indeed," said Gwladys, smiling.
</p>

<p>
"No, no! the Mishteer knew better than to
make it too grand for you; it would be too great
a change.  But that is a beautiful chair you are
sitting on&mdash;solid oak, I see!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Gwladys, rising; "Hugh had it
made for me."
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb!"[<a id="chap07fn8text"></a><a href="#chap07fn8">8</a>] said both women, raising
their hands in astonishment, "a red velvet
cushion!  Wel! wel! the queen couldn't have
anything better!  But there, we all know how an
old lover spoils his wife!"
</p>

<p>
Here Nell turned to the dresser.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, to be sure! the dresser looks nice; I
have heard tell it is the best-dressed dresser in
the parish; but so many things alike.  For
my part, I like different colours&mdash;green, blue, and
pink, not all pink like these.  And what are
these?" and she gingerly raised the covers of two
vegetable dishes, which stood one each side of
the dresser shelf.
</p>

<p>
"They are for the potatoes and cabbages,"
said Gwladys meekly, feeling that she was indeed
in danger of hurting the susceptibilities of her
touchy neighbours by the exhibition of her
treasures; "and those are the dishes&mdash;six plates and
three dishes, and two little ones for gravy; they
called it a dinner service at the shop at Caer
Madoc."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps indeed!" said Sara, whose mingled
feelings of jealousy and astonishment could only
be expressed by this never-failing phrase.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Nell was walking round the room,
examining with curious eyes and busy fingers
every little adornment which the cosy cottage
contained; but the coffor was the object of their
deepest admiration.
</p>

<p>
"Look at the polish of it!" said Nell, who
was not so clever as Sara at hiding her feelings.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys with pride opened every drawer.
</p>

<p>
"Full to the brim!" said Nell, with gasping
envy.  "I expect old 'Ebenezer' will be well
filled on Sunday; everyone is looking out for
your new jacket."
</p>

<p>
"They will be disappointed then," said
Gwladys, laughing, "for Hugh comes with me
to Brynseion from this time forward."
</p>

<p>
"Wel! wel! the Mishteer has given up his
soul to you!" in a tone half spiteful, half abject,
for "to give up his chapel" was synonymous
with "giving up his soul," even though it was
only to attend another of the same denomination
more conveniently situated.
</p>

<p>
At this last proof of Hugh Morgan's complete
subjection to his wife's charms the two women
were quite overcome, and when they went away
they made their adieux in more humble tones,
and tacked a "mem" and a bob curtesy on to the
end!  But it was only until they were out of
sight that this meek behaviour continued, for as
they walked up the road they drew closer
together, and with sundry nudges and winks
discussed the situation.
</p>

<p>
"Did ever man see such a thing?" said Sara.
"A red velvet-cushion! didst ever hear of such a
thing?  Nani's daughter to sit upon a red velvet
cushion!  No wonder her stool in the sail-shed is
so often empty!  Wel! wel! the ways of Providence
are puzzling indeed.  But of all things in
the world, Nell, f√¢ch&mdash;the dishes for the potatoes!
Wouldn't basins do, I should like to know?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  I don't expect they use them," said
Nell.  "What did she call them?  Some
English name."
</p>

<p>
"'A dinner service,' if you please," said Sara,
in tones of disgust.  "Ach y fi! what is the
world coming to when Nani's daughter sits on a
red velvet cushion, and has a 'dinner service'
on her dresser? dost know what, Nell, f√¢ch?  I
am sick of the world; it is so foolish.  And
didst see her ring? as thick as two, Nell, f√¢ch!
Wel, wel! the poor Mishteer has made a fool of
himself at last!  'Dwla dwl yw dwl h√™n!'[<a id="chap07fn9text"></a><a href="#chap07fn9">9</a>]
But, Nell," with another nudge and a shrewd
wink, "we've got to curtsey to her, my woman.
But we've got to hide our feelings in this world,
Nell, f√¢ch.  There's two pigs in the sty; and
that pretty poppet won't do all the salting
herself, I'll be bound.  And there's the herrings to
be salted in the autumn.  I won't mind doing the
work for her, but there's many a bit of pork can
be spared from the salting, and I daresay she'll
throw a dozen or two of herrings into my pay!"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I can salt as well as thee," said Nell,
"and I can set the garden for them&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, I daresay thee'lt pick something
out of them!" said Sara.  "So we must curtsey
and say, 'mem' to Mishtress.  Ach y fi!  I am
tired of this old world.  There's Shemi coming
home, I must go and put the cawl on; good-night."
</p>

<p>
As they turned into their cottages, Hugh came
whistling down the road.  He had settled his
business in the farm on the moor, and was
returning with hurrying steps to the home which
held his young bride; for, no doubt, in a great
measure the old proverb was right, and Hugh,
the man of forty, was more absolutely enslaved
by the new-born passion which had come into
his life than a younger man would have been.
The thought of Gwladys filled his heart to the
exclusion for the time of every other consideration.
She was the sweetest and fairest woman
in the world&mdash;the peerless pearl of all the
maidens!&mdash;and his whole life should be devoted to her
happiness.  He would guard her path from every
danger; he would brush every thorn away, and
spread it with flowers for her to walk upon; and
as he saw the light which twinkled from his
window, and pictured Gwladys' slim figure moving
about the room, his heart leapt up with joy, and
life seemed to stretch before him in one long
boundless haze of happiness.  He passed 'n'wncwl
Jos standing at his cottage door with a nod only.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha!" said the old man, "'tis no use asking
you to come in now&mdash;too much attraction at
home, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Hugh, stopping a moment, "'tis
too late to-night, and I don't like to leave the
little one alone, you see; but to-morrow night,
she is going to see Nani, and I'll come up and sit
with thee and Mari.  How is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Quite well," said 'n'wncwl Jos.  "She has
been hay-making all day, and has not come home
yet."
</p>

<p>
On the following Sunday the worshippers at
Brynseion Chapel paid less attention than usual
to their minister's fiery sermon.  Gwladys Morgan's
jacket had been the subject of their thoughts
and conversation during the foregoing week, and
now here it was in all its glory of lace and bead
trimming, plainly exposed to every eye&mdash;nay,
Sara Pentraeth and Nell Jones had been so
fortunate as to secure seats in the very next pew
behind the Mishteer and Mishtress, so that they
were able correctly to appraise its value.  Nell's
eyes as usual roamed over every bead and frill,
and a series of unconscious nudges in Sara's side
expressed the feelings which the presence of the
minister and congregation obliged her to conceal.
Hugh had commissioned a friend, a sea-captain,
to buy the jacket for him at a large seaport
town up the bay.  The price was to be no object,
but fashion and good taste alone were to be
considered, and consequently its arrival had created
quite a little ferment in the village.  Gwladys,
when it was presented to her the day after her
marriage, went into the expected raptures; but,
truth to tell, its grandeur threw a shadow over
her Sundays, and though Nani looked across the
chapel at her with beaming admiration, she was
glad to exchange it for her quiet Welsh flannel
dress when the three services of the day were
over, and Hugh and she could doff their broadcloth
and silk, and lay them to rest in the coffer
until the following Sunday.  It was midsummer,
and as they emerged from the crowded chapel
on the day when the glories of the jacket first
dazzled the eyes of Mwntseison, the sweet, pure
air greeted them like a blessing.  The road,
shaded on both sides with old gnarled elder trees,
was white with the fallen blossoms, the scent of
which mingled with that of the wild honeysuckle
climbing over the hedges.
</p>

<p>
They stopped a moment to lean over a bridge
which crossed the little stream just where it took
a headlong leap over the rocks down to the
lower level, upon which it made its more sober
way through the village into the sea.  The spray
from the waterfall wetted their faces as they
looked through the honeysuckle and ivy into the
depths below.  The swallows darted backwards
and forwards where the water filled the air with
its rushing sound.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a gay world, lass, eh?" said Hugh,
looking with almost wistful tenderness into
Gwladys' face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," she answered; "'tis a pity we
live in houses; we lose a lot of beauty so."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh; "but to me, now, the real
beauty and happiness of life are at home.  Since
I have thee always with me, my life seems to be
almost too full of joy.  Dost feel the same,
f'anwylyd?  Art as happy with me?"
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was a rushing sound in
her ears which drowned the sound of the waterfall,
and tears filled her eyes as she sought for a
truthful answer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hugh, b√¢ch!" she said at last, "who
could live with thee without loving thee?
Indeed I am far happier than I deserve to be&mdash;my
only trouble is lest I should not fill thy life
completely; but if thou art telling the truth, and dost
not find anything wanting in me, that is all I
want."
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, merch i, nothing," said Hugh.
And he spoke the truth, for he had not as yet
fully realised that there was a something wanting
in his cup of happiness; while in Gwladys' heart,
every fresh proof of her husband's passionate
love seemed to press deeper the barb of unrest
and misery which was poisoning her life.  His
tender words, his caresses only deepened her
sense of loss, while, added to her own sorrow,
pity for Hugh Morgan began to awaken within
her.  She had not realised that the bitterness
could not be hers alone, but that through her it
would reach the man who loved her, and whom
she admired and honoured so much.
</p>

<p>
"Could I only tell mother; but no!"  She
felt she must hide her misery from every human
eye, and, above all, from Hugh, whose heart the
knowledge would break.  Yes, whatever it cost
her, she must hide it from him; and she must
make more strenuous efforts to appear and be
glad in Hugh's love, and in all the comforts
surrounding her.
</p>

<p>
All this passed through her mind while she
watched the swallows darting through the spray
and listened to the rush of the waterfall.  She
turned to her husband with as merry a smile as
she could call to her lips.
</p>

<p>
"Come, 'mach-geni, we must not quite forget
our home in watching the birds and the
water; let us go home."
</p>

<p>
There was a ring of gaiety in the speech
which Hugh felt and responded to at once, and
leaning over the bridge he reached a wild rose
which grew out of the mossy masonry.
</p>

<p>
"A posy for my darling," he said, offering it
to her.
</p>

<p>
She took it, smiling, and fastened it on her
breast in spite of the silk jacket; and Hugh
Morgan turned homewards a happy man.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
CONFIDENCES.
</h3>

<p>
The summer and autumn months slipped by,
bringing but little change to Mwntseison.  The
hay harvest brought its usual sweet additions to
the charms of the season&mdash;the scent of the dry
hay and meadow-sweet on the air, the call of the
corncrake in the grey evenings, the wisps of hay
left hanging on the hedges by the laden waggons.
The men and women had all become a shade
browner from exposure to the sun, for even the
work of the sail-shed was suspended for the
haymaking; and there was not a man, woman, or
child who did not find some excuse for tossing
the hay.  The air seemed full of song, for people
at Mwntseison always felt the work went better
while they sang in chorus together.  In the
sail-shed there was a murmur of singing, commenced
by the women and taken up by the lads and men
until alto, tenor, and bass filled up the harmony.
Best of all went the music when the Mishteer's
rich voice joined in in the bass.  A favourite glee
was The Herring Boat, which went with so
tuneful a swing that it seemed to suit every kind
of occupation and experience.
</p>

<p>
The children sang it sitting in little groups on
the warm sand, the sailors on the bay, and the
haymakers in the field; but oftenest of all, the
walls of the old sail-shed echoed to its tones.  It
ran as follows, though English words can but
poorly express the vivid brightness of the original:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Out there on the raging sea<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wind is high;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing but foam and mist to see<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the sky!<br />
  Father and mother, come down to the shore;<br />
  Friends and neighbours, stand at the door;<br />
  Pray&mdash;if you never have prayed before&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'Lord, hear our cry!'<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torn sails and broken mast&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh! let the boat come home at last!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ja houp, hal!  Ja houp, hal!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hal!  Hal!  Hal!  Hal!<br />
</p>

<p>
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Out there on the stormy main<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A calm has come!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sunshine chases the wind and rain,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And gilds the foam.<br />
  Father and mother, come down to the shore;<br />
  Friends and neighbours, come out to the door;<br />
  And shout&mdash;if you never have shouted before&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A welcome home!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Torn sails and broken mast&mdash;<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The boat is safe at home at last!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ja houp, hal!  Ja houp, hal!<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hal!  Hal!  Hal!  Hal!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The corn harvest was nearly over before the
news reached the village of Ivor Parry's
convalescence.
</p>

<p>
The Lapwing had flitted across the bay to the
northern port, and had returned, bearing the
news of his recovery and many warm greetings
from him to his friends at Mwntseison.
</p>

<p>
"Tell me exactly how he was, my lad.  I
hunger to hear something of him," said Hugh
Morgan to the youthful captain of the little ship,
and speaking English, for sailors possessed the
distinguishing accomplishment of being able to
speak the English language, and are proud of it.
Hugh himself spoke it fluently and grammatically,
though with a broad Welsh accent.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, he wass looking pale and thin," replied
Captain Jones, "and the daughter of the
house brought a chair for him to sit on outside
the door.  Gwladys is her name, and she's a
purty girl, too!
</p>

<p>
"'There,' he says, 'turn my chair where the
wind will blow straight from the sea.'
</p>

<p>
"'Tis blowing straight across the bay
today,' sez I.  ''Tis coming later from Mwntseison
than me, though I only left yesterday morning.'
</p>

<p>
"Wel, he didn't say nothin' to that, but he
took a long breath, and he sighed very heavy."
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, I'll soon be well now,' he sez, 'and
begin my work again.'  And when I was parting,
he sez: 'Remember me to the Mishteer,' sez he,
'and tell him that distance don't make no
difference at all in my friendship for him.'"
</p>

<p>
"And what message to the Mishtress?"
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, yes, of course,' he sez, 'my kind
remembrances to her, too!' and he didn't say no
more."
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's enough," said Hugh, returning
to his Welsh, "to know that he is getting well,
and that his heart is with us yet.  We'll have
him back again yet, boys.  We'll send him a
'round robin,' and every one in Mwntseison shall
sign it.  Thee and I shall be the first to sign it.
Dost hear, Gwladys?  But thee must sprack up,
girl, or Ivor will ask me what I've been doing
to thee to make thee so pale and thin!"  And he,
too, sighed heavily, as Ivor had.
</p>

<p>
The winter months sped on, and the spring
once more awakened land and sea.  On one
of her brightest and freshest mornings the doors
of the sail-shed stood wide open, as they had done
a year ago, and Hugh Morgan as usual worked
busily amongst his men, arranging, watching,
directing with indefatigable spirit, though, truth
to tell, things had been going rather against him
lately.  He missed Ivor's watchful interest in his
business, and his absence, like an intangible
cloud, somewhat tarnished the brightness of his
life.
</p>

<p>
At the first glance, Hugh's manly form and
handsome face seems unchanged, but a closer
scrutiny reveals a haunting sadness behind his
genial smile.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys was also present, and was busily
engaged in directing some portion of the work
which she took under her own particular surveillance,
and part of which she was able to do in
her own home, much against her husband's
wishes, for he would have liked to see her spend
her days, her time, and his money in pleasure
only; but the time hung heavily on her hands,
and she felt herself perforce obliged to seek for
work outside her own home, and playfully
insisted upon taking upon her a portion of the work
to which she had been accustomed from childhood.
</p>

<p>
"Wilt come up to-night, Nell," she said, as
she left the shed one day, "and bring up those
reef points and the new flag for me to hem?
There's a bag of sucan[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] and half a cheese you
can have."
</p>

<p>
"Tank'ee, tank'ee, Mishtress f√¢ch," said Nell,
standing up to make a series of bob curtseys;
"there's good you are to me, and I will bring
you a bunch of 'moon rocket.'  I gathered it
when the moon was full in a cleft of the rocks at
Traeth-y-daran.  'Tis splendid for bringing the
colour back to your blood.  Will you try it,
mem?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Gwladys, "I will try it to please
thee, Nell.  From Traeth-y-daran, didst say?
Bring it to me; but I am quite well," and she
left the shed, Hugh looking after her with a
wistful sadness, for it was now very evident that
the girl, who a year ago might have stood for a
picture of "Hebe," had now lost much of the
full ripe form, as well as the glow of health, which
had once made her so peculiarly attractive.  She
was still very fair and lovely, perhaps more so
than before, but in a different way.  Her dark
brown eyes had deep shadows beneath them, and
her lips a curve of sadness.  What was the cause
of this sudden failing of health?  Hugh tried in
vain to discover, and he was fast resigning himself
to the belief that her delicacy was due to that
much-dreaded disease, consumption, which was
very prevalent in that neighbourhood.  Whether
from the continual intermarriage of the villagers
on the coast, or from some other cause, this cruel
disease is very rife amongst the young people of
both sexes; and Hugh looked every day, with
nervous fears, for signs of the dreaded enemy.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys laughed at his fears, however, and
continued to declare she was quite well.
</p>

<p>
Mari Vone, who was her most intimate friend
and companion, was as much puzzled as Hugh
at first.  With the quick intuition of a loving
heart, she had soon discovered that Hugh and
Gwladys' marriage had not brought to either of
them the complete happiness which she had
expected would follow their union.  She spent
some part of every day in Gwladys' home, either
helping in the household duties or sitting with
her at work, engaged in those long chats which
seem to fill up any blank there may be in the
lives of women, as smoking does with men.  She
never stayed later than four or five o'clock, and
Hugh was wont to reproach her playfully with
always leaving before he came home.  Though
Mari pleasantly laughed away his reproaches, it
was true that she could not look on unmoved
while the man who yet reigned supreme in her
heart caressed and dallied with his young wife.
It was true that she was not yet strong enough
to feel no bitterness of spirit when she saw the
tender affection which Hugh lavished upon
Gwladys, and which seemed to be received by her
without the reciprocal delight which Mari herself
would have felt.  Her pure and unselfish love
made her desire his happiness before any earthly
good, and it wounded her true heart to see that
he missed something in his wife, without plainly
realising that he did so, or, at all events, without
confessing it even to himself.
</p>

<p>
It was during one of these long chats, when
the two friends sat knitting at the cottage door,
that the suspicion first dawned upon her which
was afterwards to develop into such a miserable
certainty.  They had sat silent for some time,
both heads bent over their clicking knitting
needles, when Mari looked up and spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, wyrl Lallo's new pig seems to be as
noisy as the last year's.  You can always hear
them abusing each other."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Gwladys, laughing; "I think, between
the baby and the pig, Siencyn will be glad
to go to sea again."
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a crying baby, indeed," said Mari; "a
frail little thing.  I'm afraid it will not live."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I hope so!  It would break poor
Gwen's heart to lose it.  I can't think why&mdash;but
she's always very spiteful to me."
</p>

<p>
"To thee!" said Mari.  "Why?  I wonder&mdash;but
she dare not show her spite to the Mishtress,
surely!  Poor Gwen!  I pity her.  Didst
know she was very fond of Ivor Parry once?"
</p>

<p>
A crimson blush overspread Gwladys' face as
she bent more closely over her knitting&mdash;a blush
that faded as quickly as it had appeared, leaving
on her face a deathly pallor, though she answered
in a calm voice:
</p>

<p>
"I remember hearing something of it."
</p>

<p>
Mari saw the blush and the pallor, and quickly
changed the conversation, for if there was one
trait in her character more conspicuous than
another, it was tenderness, and, with a spasm of
pain, she perceived she had touched upon a secret
in Gwladys' life.
</p>

<p>
"It is drawing near tea-time; I must go.
'N'wncwl Jos is so punctual!  the tap of his
wooden leg is almost as good as a clock."
</p>

<p>
"Here is Hugh," said Gwladys, and she ran
to the gate to meet him.
</p>

<p>
There was only the usual "Wel, merch i!"
and "Wel, Hugh!" at meeting, for the Welsh,
although so emotional&mdash;perhaps because of this&mdash;are
very chary of any exhibition of tenderness
in public.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! now I have caught thee, Mari, going
to slip away as usual just as I come in.  Indeed,
now, stay to tea.  'N'wncwl Jos has gone out in
the Speedwell, and she will not be back till nine
o'clock; he told me to tell thee.  Come, sit thee
down, and keep Gwladys and me company."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then I will, and I can fry those light-cakes
for thee, Gwladys."  And before long they
were seated round the oak table, in the shade of
the big chimney, for the evenings were still cold,
although it was May.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys hovered round her husband with all
sorts of little nameless attentions, endeavouring,
as she always did, by faithfully performing and
even exceeding in every wifely duty to make up
to him for the love which was lacking in her.
</p>

<p>
"There's a bonnie pile of lightcakes," said
Hugh, "as tall as Caer Madoc church-steeple;
but never mind, I'll soon knock the pinnacle off
it!" and he flipped two or three on to Gwladys'
and Mari's plates.
</p>

<p>
"One at a time, Hugh b√¢ch," said Gwladys.
"Thee wouldst soon make me ill if thou hadst
thy way."
</p>

<p>
"I'm afraid I have had my way, lass.  Dost
see how pale she is, Mari?  What shall we do to
her?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think, take her for a trip on the
Aden Ydon.  She sails for Cork in June.  That
would bring her roses back."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps indeed," said Hugh.  "But how
shall I manage it?  I have had complaints of the
work in the sail-shed from many quarters lately,
and I must watch it closer.  But one thing is
certain, I must ask Ivor Parry to come back,
and that won't hurt my pride, for we've always
been like brothers, and I believe his friendship
is mine still."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of that," said Mari, endeavouring
to attract Hugh's notice from his wife, who
sat with bent head, changing from white to red,
and from red to white.
</p>

<p>
When Hugh had left the house, she raised
her hands, which had been clasped on her lap,
and covered her drooping face with them, while
Mari, pretending not to notice her, bustled about
clearing the tea-table; but so long did she
remain in this position that it was useless longer
to ignore it, so, drawing a stool to her side, she
gently tried to draw away the hands which
Gwladys still kept over her face, and was
surprised to find them wet with tears.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys, anwl! what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"Something I must not tell you!" said the
young wife, with head still bent, the tears
coursing each other down her cheeks; "something I
must keep for ever here,"&mdash;and she smote her
breast with her clenched hand&mdash;"until I lie in
my coffin.  You heard Hugh say everything has
gone wrong with him lately?  It is true, Mari
f√¢ch.  Oh, everything is wrong!  The whole
world is twisted and torn, and I long to escape
from it."
</p>

<p>
Mari sat beside her, holding one of her hands
in stricken silence.  "Ts, ts!" was all she said,
while Gwladys' tears flowed unrestrainedly.
</p>

<p>
"Poor Hugh! poor Hugh!" she said between
her sobs; and Mari cried too, but softly.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard that once Hugh and thee were
lovers, Mari?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, in the old, old past, Gwladys.  Now his
heart is thine alone, and my only prayer is that
he should be happy with thee.  Dost believe
me, merch i?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I believe all that is good of thee, Mari.
Thou art an angel somehow straying on earth.
Wilt be my guardian angel, and love me still,
though I am so weak and sinful?  Oh, why did
not Hugh marry thee, instead of me?  I believe
in his heart of hearts he loves thee still, although
he has been carried away by a sudden wind of
passion.  Yes&mdash;yes; there has been some terrible
mistake," and she started to her feet almost
wildly, "and it can never be set right&mdash;never, never,
never!"  And with the last word she flung
herself down on the settle, crying bitterly.
</p>

<p>
Mari waited a moment in dazed silence.
</p>

<p>
"Art better, merch i?" she said at length,
when the sobs began to grow less violent; and
stooping down, and whispering so softly that not
even the proverbial walls could hear, she said,
"Now, no word of explaining; none is wanted
between thee and me; we have been soul to soul
together to-day.  I know all thy secret, and I
think thou knowest mine!"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys' lips moved in assent, but she seemed
too broken down for more.
</p>

<p>
"Listen again," said Mari.  "We are both
women whose dream of happiness has been shattered;
but there is still one thing which we can
work for as long as life shall last&mdash;Hugh's
happiness.  Can we work together, Gwladys f√¢ch? can
we still be friends with these bitter secrets
between us?  It is for thee to settle."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys' only answer was to raise her arms
and clasp them round Mari's neck, drawing her
close to her in a long embrace, during which
some silent tears were shed by both.
</p>

<p>
"Never leave me, Mari!"
</p>

<p>
"Never!"

CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
GWEN'S REBELLION.
</h3>

<p>
"Where is Gwen?" said Hugh Morgan,
looking at an unoccupied stool at one end of
the sail-shed; "she has not been here for two
days."
</p>

<p>
"No," said one of her friends, "she's at
home, Mishteer.  Her little baby is ill, and she
and Lallo are wild with fear of losing her."
</p>

<p>
"Ts, ts, that's a pity!  Has she had a doctor?"
</p>

<p>
"Malen hysbys[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>] has been there, and the
child would have been well by now, but that
Siencyn would open the window before he sailed
yesterday; of course the little one caught cold,
and now I'm afraid&mdash;&mdash;" and she shook her
head mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said the Mishteer, "I must go
and see about getting a doctor for her."  And
he left the shed, and passed up the road towards
Gwen's cottage, upon reaching which, he found
her deeply intent upon a morsel of raw meat,
which she was roasting on a fork before the fire.
Her little baby, meanwhile, white and moaning,
lay across Lallo's knees, who also seemed much
interested in the bit of meat.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gwen, I am sorry to hear your little
one is ill; but diranwl! babies have nine lives
and recover from all sorts of illnesses."
</p>

<p>
Gwen scarcely withdrew her eyes from her
cooking to answer.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! of course, I know that, Mishteer, I
know she will be well soon; but if you had a
child of your own, you would know 'tis a cruel
thing to see it suffering!"
</p>

<p>
"B'tshwr, indeed!" said Hugh.  "I can
quite understand that; but what is it that you are
cooking?"
</p>

<p>
"A mouse," said Gwen.  "Malen hysbys says
a roasted mouse will cure my baby."
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb!" said Hugh, "what nonsense,
Gwen!  I will send for Dr. Hughes; he ought to
have been here sooner.  A roasted mouse,
indeed.  Where did she hear that from?  From
Peggi Sh√¢n?"
</p>

<p>
"Peggi Sh√¢n knew more than Dr. Hughes a
good deal," said Gwen; "and if she was alive
now my baby would not be suffering; but it will
be well by to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"I hope so, indeed," said Hugh; "but if you
do not let Dr. Hughes see it, I think it will die,
Gwen; that is the plain truth, and there is no use
hiding it.  I will send for him at once.  And
throw away that nasty thing you are roasting,"
he added as he left the house.
</p>

<p>
"Die!" said Gwen fiercely; "she shall not
die!  There's calmly he says 'die!'  I wish I
had never let that wife of his touch my baby; it
hasn't been well since she nursed it here one
day."
</p>

<p>
As she spoke, through the open doorway
came the sounds of singing from a knot of
women and children passing by.
</p>

<p>
"Hard-hearted wretches!" she said, viciously
pounding the mouse, which had been cooked to a
cinder.  "They can laugh and sing while my
child is sick; they don't care.  But their time will
come!" she added, as she mixed the dark powder
with some brown sugar and butter, and, with
cooing, tender words, she coaxed the little
moaning baby to swallow the unsavory morsel.  At
the same time Dr. Hughes entered, breezy and
fresh from his drive over the hill.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he called, as his portly form filled
up the whole doorway.  "What's wrong here?
I met Hugh Morgan down the road, and he told
me I was wanted here.  What is it, Gwen?
Hello!" he said again, in quite an altered tone,
as he caught sight of the little panting baby, its
pretty lips discoloured with smears of butter and
sugar and something worse.  "What's this?"
and he looked in anger from one woman to
another.  "How dare you!  You have been trying
some of your filthy messes again, and with the
usual result.  You have killed your baby.  Had
you sent for me in time, I might have saved him;
it is now too late."
</p>

<p>
At the words "too late" Gwen screamed, and
snatched the little one from its grandmother's
lap.  Disturbed by the scream it opened its eyes
for a moment, and then died with a little
fluttering gasp.
</p>

<p>
"There, lay it down, poor little thing," said
the doctor; "you can do no more for it; but
next time you see a baby dying, don't add to its
pain by stuffing filthy things into its mouth."
</p>

<p>
Gwen fixed her heavy-lidded eyes upon the
doctor with an angry look, saying:
</p>

<p>
"Go out of my house if you can do no good,
and leave me to my sorrow.  You will repent of
this."
</p>

<p>
"Of what, woman?"
</p>

<p>
She made no answer further than to point to
the door, and Dr. Hughes went out, shrugging
his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
Through the open doorway the singing of
the children came in on the breeze.
</p>

<p>
"Fileiniaid," Gwen said, shaking her clenched
fist at the doorway.  "I hate them.  Are they
all to be happy while I am miserable?" and
hastily rising, she took her little dead baby in her
arms, and pressing it to her bosom, paced
moaning up and down the room; while Lallo, even in
her fresh sorrows remembering the village
proprieties, closed the door and covered up the little
window with a pocket handkerchief, and, with
no little difficulty, at last persuaded Gwen to lay
the child on the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Extraordinary woman that Gwen," said Dr. Hughes,
as he called by the sail-shed to report
to Hugh Morgan.  "Devilish temper.  Second
Peggi Sh√¢n.  You see if I'm not right.  The
little baby?  Oh, dead as a herring, its last
moments disturbed by some filthy concoction stuffed
into its mouth."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I know, indeed," said Hugh; "a
roasted mouse.  I saw her cooking it."  And
Dr. Hughes drove away with an oath.
</p>

<p>
"Mari," said 'n'wncwl Jos one day as he
stumped in from the sunshine; "isn't there a
hole in Lallo's penucha?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mari, looking at him with some
surprise.  "There is a short board near the
fireplace, where the damp earth comes quite near to
the top.  It was going to be finished fifteen
years ago when the floor was boarded, but
the hole is still there.  Why, 'n'wncwl Jos?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nothing," said the old man.  "Hast
heard the little one is to be buried on Monday?
and to-morrow night there's to be a gwylnos.[<a id="chap09fn2text"></a><a href="#chap09fn2">2</a>]
Wilt come, Mari?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed," she said.  "I will come to the
prayer meeting, because then I can sit at the
door or in the passage; but to be shut up all
night in a room with a dead body makes me
faint, and besides, I don't like a gwylnos."
</p>

<p>
"Wel, no," said her uncle; "I know both
thou and Hugh Morgan are very odd in some
things, and that is one thing&mdash;not to like a
gwylnos.  Wel, I'm going anyway," and he
stumped vigorously, and put on a defiant look.
"What is the good of my never having married
if I'm going to be ruled by a woman after all?
Caton pawb!  Wouldst like us to bury our dead
as the Saeson[<a id="chap09fn3text"></a><a href="#chap09fn3">3</a>] do?  To shut the door upon
them and say, 'There! we've finished with you;
you stop there by yourself in the dark!'  And
then click with the key, and sit down in the warm
kitchen to a comfortable meal, and talk about
who's to have his clothes?  No, no!  Lallo and
I are too old friends for me to desert her now in
her trouble; so to the gwylnos I'll go, merch i,
whatever thou say'st!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, b'dsiwr! if you like, 'n'wncwl Jos,"
said Mari; "and I only meant that I didn't like
the drinking and talking that goes on at a gwylnos,
for death is too solemn a thing for such nonsense."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, j√¢r-i!  I agree with thee there.  For a
man to lie there, stiff and cold, hearing and
saying nothing, while his friends are smoking and
chatting near him, good liquor passing around
him and he knowing nothing about it&mdash;well, yes! 'tis
a solemn thing!  But that's no reason why
we shouldn't stay with the poor fellow as long
as he is above ground, if it was only to comfort
his relatives!"  And he began to "furrage" in
an old sea-chest, where he kept his own personal
treasures safely under lock and key, bringing out
from its depths one of the square, high-shouldered
bottles of "Hollands" which he had collected
in a mysterious manner during his sea-faring
days.  Having closed the chest with a
bang, he hid the bottle under his rough pilot
coat, and made his way up to Lallo's cottage.
His low tap at the door was answered by Gwen
herself.
</p>

<p>
"So sorry, calon f√¢ch!" he said, "for thy
trouble and for Lallo's.  This is for the gwylnos,
merch i; give it to thy mother," and he held out
the square bottle.
</p>

<p>
Gwen made no answer, but turned away and
called her mother, leaving 'n'wncwl Jos with
outstretched arms at the doorway.
</p>

<p>
"J√¢r-i! there's manners!" he muttered to
himself.
</p>

<p>
But if Gwen was scant of gratitude, Lallo
made up for it to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
"'N'wncwl Jos b√¢ch!  There's kind you are
to remember us in our trouble.  A hundred
thanks! and I hope you will be at the gwylnos;
I will never forget your kindness!"
</p>

<p>
"Twt, twt! hisht about kindness," said the
old man, backing from the doorway, in fear lest
he might be asked in "to see the body," a
compliment considered due to everyone who knocked
at the door.
</p>

<p>
On the following day, which was Sunday,
after every service in the two chapels was added
the notice, given out by one of the deacons in
the "set fawr" or big seat under the pulpit:
</p>

<p>
"There will be a prayer-meeting at the house
of Lallo Hughes this evening at eight o'clock,
to be followed by a gwylnos for any friends who
are wishful to attend."
</p>

<p>
In the gloaming, when the many services of
the day were over, the congregations trooped
down towards Lallo's cottage.  Of course, there
was no room inside, but they overflowed into the
cwrt and into the roadway, where they stood in
the gathering twilight, only hearing a faint
murmur of the prayers which were offered up inside
the house; but still they waited patiently, listening
to the rising and falling of the prayers, which
mingled with the soft sighing of the sea, and
speaking to each other in whispers.
</p>

<p>
Lallo, who managed to get a furtive peep
through the corner of the covered-up window,
was much comforted by the presence of such a
crowd of sympathisers, and called to mind with
satisfaction that at the last gwylnos in the
village, there had not been so large a gathering.
</p>

<p>
Mari Vone sat on the low hedge of the cwrt,
looking over the sea, where she was joined by
Hugh Morgan and his wife.
</p>

<p>
"Canst hear, Mari?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
"No, nothing!  But I've been listening to
the sea, and I quite forgot the prayer-meeting,
whatever."
</p>

<p>
Hugh opened his eyes, with a smiling
pretence of reproof.
</p>

<p>
"Where is 'n'wncwl Jos?" he whispered;
and Mari pointed to the doorway.  Hugh looked
grave.  "Is he going to stay to the gwylnos?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Mari, with an uneasy look on
her face.
</p>

<p>
"Wouldst like me to stay, lass?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh! no, Hugh b√¢ch! and you hating a
gwylnos as much as I do!"
</p>

<p>
"Twt, twt!" said Hugh, and he elbowed his
way into the crowded passage.
</p>

<p>
The meeting was fortunately drawing to a
close when Hugh entered, for the air in the
small, close room was intolerably stifling.  In
the penucha he discovered the old man sitting
close to the coffin, which stood across the
fireplace.  He had found the square hole in the
boards, and had been able to get safely through
the meeting without disturbing the gathering by
the sound of his wooden leg, for in the soft earth
he had been able to stump unheard.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mishteer!" he said, when the dispersing
of the crowd and the comparative emptying
of the cottage enabled him to draw near
his friend, "there's beautiful prayers we had!
There's no doubt Sam Saer beats anyone in
Mwntseison on his knees.  Are you going to
stop to the gwylnos?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, what d'ye think?" said Hugh.  "'Tis
shocking close here, and the room is too full.
I think Lallo will be glad to get rid of a few of
us.  I'll stop if thou lik'st; but I was thinking
perhaps thee and Mari would come in and have
supper with us to-night.  There's one of the
ducks since dinner got to be eaten, and we've
tapped the fresh cask, and it's as clear as
cryshal&mdash;thanks to thy secret, 'n'wncwl Jos!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed, I think I will come," said the
old man, "for I've sat by that coffin till I'm stiff.
Good-bye, Lallo f√¢ch!" he said, turning into the
penisha.  "I see you have so many friends here,
I will only be in the way.  Good-bye, Gwen
f√¢ch!  I will be at the funeral to-morrow."  And
he searched his memory for one of the stock
phrases which he tried to carry with him on
such occasions.  "Cheer up, merch i, and
remember what the Bible says, 'Would God I
had died for thee, my son!'"
</p>

<p>
When the Mishteer had piloted him safely
into the soft evening air, he was rewarded by a
look of gratitude from Mari's blue eyes.
</p>

<p>
"'N'wncwl Jos and you are coming to supper
with us, Mari; he has agreed to come, so
now don't you hold back."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, well, that's a good thing," said Mari,
"for I have already promised Gwladys to come."
</p>

<p>
Lallo and her friends were already forming a
semicircle around the bright fire, Gwen sitting
straight and silent in the corner.  Hour after
hour of the long night they sat there talking, at
first quietly and solemnly, but as the night wore
on, and the contents of 'n'wncwl Jos's bottle was
handed round, tongues were loosed and
conversation flowed more freely.
</p>

<p>
Stories were told of "corpse candles" which
wound their flickering way from cottage to
churchyard; of phantom funerals, in which the
narrator had been so closely pressed by the
unseen crowd as nearly to lose his breath, and
become himself one of the mysterious company
of "cwn bendith y mamman"&mdash;the weird invisible
pack of hounds, whose yelping chorus rushes
by on the wings of the wind; and many other
tales, but always ending with the words, "but
that was in the olden time, you know!  Now,
of course, we're wiser!"  Their vaunted wisdom,
however, did not prevent their cowering more
closely over the blazing logs when the wind
moaned in the chimney as it swept up the valley
in the small hours of the morning, when one
day was dead and the other was scarcely living.
In the early morning, when the grey dawn came
in as well as it could through the little covered
window, everyone was glad to welcome it, and
to blow out the candles which stood at the head
of the coffin, to hang the kettle on the hook over
the fire, and to help Lallo with her preparations
for breakfast, returning without regret to the
material pleasures of tea and buttered toast from
their incursions into the realm of darkness and
mystery.
</p>

<p>
On the third day after its death, the little one
was laid to rest, followed by all the inhabitants
of Mwntseison&mdash;for a funeral, no matter of how
young a child, is an important function in Wales,
and few within an area of two miles will fail to
attend it, for there is a chance of hearing a
sermon, and the certainty of an old Welsh hymn
or two; and if there be anything on earth
calculated to move the feelings, and awaken
sleeping memories, it is a Welsh funeral hymn.  Its
rising and falling strains, always in a minor key,
are harrowing to the feelings of the bereaved; but
by those not too closely interested, their
emotional character is thoroughly enjoyed.
</p>

<p>
Lallo's small cottage was crowded, the throng
overflowing into the garden and the road; and
when the little coffin was carried out, and the
large concourse of people, outside and in, joined
in the funeral hymn, its wailing, dirge-like notes,
rising and falling on the air, touched poor Lallo's
heart beyond endurance, and she moaned and
wept loudly, her sobs being accompanied by
many a sympathising tear from the crowd; but
Gwen walked beside her, silent and tearless, with
a hard, angry gleam in her eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing! poor thing!" whispered the
women; "she can't cry; there's a pity!  She
looks like Peggi Sh√¢n to-day!"
</p>

<p>
When, returned from the funeral, they
reached their own door, one or two neighbours
proposed to stay with her a few hours, but she
coldly answered, "No, I don't want you," and,
closing the door with a bang, bolted it noisily.
</p>

<p>
Left to herself, she looked vaguely round the
cottage, and, turning to her mother, who had
seated herself sobbing in the chimney corner,
said, in a cold, hard voice:
</p>

<p>
"What are thou crying about, woman?  It
wasn't thy child upon whose coffin the clods fell
so heavily; they were not thine, those little hands
that lay so stiff and white, that used to close so
tight round my finger.  What hast thou to cry
about?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gwen," said poor Lallo, "thou art a
strange woman.  Wasn't he mine, too?  The
very apple of my eye, calon f√¢ch!  There's sad
news for poor Siencyn when he comes home
next week!  But God knew best what was good
for him, and that is why He has taken him from
us.  The Bible says, 'The Lord gave, and the
Lord hath taken away.'"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, silence with your texts!  God, indeed!
What sort of a God must He be who gave me a
little baby to fill my empty heart, and then tore
him cruelly away?  Be quiet about your God,
mother.  If granny had been alive I would not
have wanted help from God or man."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Gwen, Gwen, hisht!" said the poor,
bewildered woman; "I know it is hard to
understand, but thou must bend before God, and say,
'He knows best.'"
</p>

<p>
"I won't," said Gwen, kicking at the embers
which had gone out on the cold hearth.  "He
can do no further harm to me.  My little
one&mdash;born in lawful wedlock, too! not like thee,
mother, nor granny, nor yet her mother!"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, it is true!" said Lallo, rocking
herself backwards and forwards; "bad luck
has followed us for generations.  But thy father
was a respectable man, Gwen; he is deacon in
his chapel at Abersethin, and his wife and family
are the best dressed in Salem Chapel.  Oh, yes,
thou hast no need to be ashamed of thy father,
though he did play me a scurvy trick in marrying
Fani Hughes; but he couldn't help it, poor
fellow!  They say Fani's brother threatened to
shoot him if he hadn't married her!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps your God took my child, then, to
punish me for your sins," said Gwen, with a
sneer.
</p>

<p>
"Sins!" said Lallo, opening her eyes.
"'Twas a misfortune that might have happened
to thee or anyone.  Sins, indeed!  That's the
first time I have ever had that word thrown in
my teeth!" and, much hurt, she began to
rekindle the fire.
</p>

<p>
Gwen made no answer, but angrily pulled
away the pocket-handkerchief which covered the
little window.  She spoke little during the day,
and the following morning was at work in the
sail-shed, pale and sulky, refusing every offer of
help, and receiving the condolences of her
neighbours with a silent contempt.
</p>

<p>
A few days afterwards the Mishteer wrote to
Ivor Parry a letter in his round, firm hand, one
that Ivor treasured for years, taking it out of his
breast-pocket, sometimes, when the curling
smoke from his evening pipe carried up in its
wreaths thoughts and memories of the sweet and
bitter past.
</p>

<p>
"Come back, mach-geni," it said.  "I cannot
do without thee.  The work calls for thee,
my heart calls for thee, and the work-people all
desire thy presence.  Thou shouldst never have
gone! there was no need.  No new tie could
ever loosen the cords of friendship that exist
between thee and me.  Nothing has gone well with
me since thou art gone.  I have had complaints
of the work from several quarters.  Sweet
Gwladys is not well; and, truth to tell, I myself
am wanting something, and it must be thee,
lad, so come back to Mwntseison, and all will
be well."  In a postscript he added: "Of course
thy pay shall be the same as that thou art
receiving now.  Indeed, I have raised the wages
of all my best workmen."
</p>

<p>
And Ivor had answered:
</p>

<p>
"I will come, for I have quite failed to make
my home at Carnarvon; and besides, if I can
truly be of help to thee, nothing will keep me
away.  The Aden Ydon goes across next
Monday, and I on board; but remember I will take
no more pay than I have always had of thee.
It was good pay, and I never wanted more; so
fforwel till we meet."
</p>

<p>
Hugh was in good spirits next day, and came
homewards at noon waving a letter round his
head.
</p>

<p>
"Good news, Gwladys f√¢ch!  Ivor will be
here next Monday, or Tuesday, or Wednesday
at latest.  Everything will be alright now.  I
feel like a new man," and so absorbed was he
with the prospect of his friend's arrival, that he
ate his dinner without noticing Gwladys'
embarrassment.
</p>

<p>
"Next week! so soon should she be called
upon to bear so much I so much bitterness, and
alas! so much joy!  But the joy must be
smothered&mdash;be crushed out, and perhaps it would die
some day."
</p>

<p>
She ate no dinner, and was thankful that
Hugh did not notice the fact.  From that
moment a restless feeling took possession of her,
and as the time for the arrival of the Aden Ydon
drew nearer, she was consumed with a feverish
dread of meeting Ivor.
</p>

<p>
Mari Vone often dropped in on one pretext
or another, and though the subject uppermost
in both their minds was never mentioned
between them, she always left Gwladys more calm
and courageous than when she entered.
</p>

<p>
On Monday the weather was dark and lowering,
what wind there was blowing from the
land, the waves scarcely breaking as they rippled
on the shore.
</p>

<p>
"The Aden Ydon won't sail to-day," said
Hugh, as he looked out under the thatched eaves
of his window in the early morning.  "But
to-morrow, perhaps, the weather will have
changed."
</p>

<p>
And so it was.  On Tuesday the wind blew
fresh and full from the north-west, and, standing
at the door of the sail-shed, telescope in hand,
Hugh watched for the first glimpse of the Aden
Ydon's white sails.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there she is!" he said, turning round
to address his people.  "Here, now, one of you
boys, run up and tell the Mishtress that Ivor
Parry will be with us before to-night."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys tried hard to keep her thoughts
from roaming out to that blue bay, which seemed
to be more <i>en evidence</i> than usual to-day.
Through every window and open door she saw
it spreading fair and broad before her.  The
swish, swish of the waves filled her ears, the air
was laden with its briny odour, and nearer and
nearer from the dim blue hills, eighty miles away,
came the white-winged ship that bore such a
freight of sorrow for her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, God forgive me!" she cried, whenever
her thoughts went over those blue waters; and
when, in the glow of the sunset, she saw the little
ship sail in to land, and disappear round the cliff
that towered high between Mwntseison and
Abersethin, she fell on her knees under the wide
chimney, and with hands crossed on her bosom,
remained a few moments in silent prayer.  She
rose calmer, and endeavoured once more to busy
herself in her household duties.
</p>

<p>
At last, when the evening shadows were closing
in, and the glow in the west had faded away,
she heard voices and footsteps coming down the
opposite hillside, and across the wooden
footbridge, and she knew that Hugh was returning
from Abersethin, and was bringing Ivor with
him.
</p>

<p>
Now the sound ceased, and she knew they
were coming up the road.  Her heart beat so
violently that she felt suffocated, and went to
the doorway, partly to meet her fate and partly
for a breath of air.
</p>

<p>
"What should she say?&mdash;how would he look?
What would Hugh think if she should faint or
falter?  God help me!" she said as the footsteps
came nearer, and in the twilight the two dark
figures entered the cwrt.
</p>

<p>
"Here he is, Gwladys," said Hugh boisterously,
"just come in to see thee on his way to
his lodgings."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys blindly held out her hand, and Ivor
took it in his.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mishtress, and how are you?" he
asked, in as cool a manner as he could command.
A slight tremor in his voice was the only
sign of feeling&mdash;there was not even the friendly
"thee" and "thou."  There was no tender,
meaning glance&mdash;no pressure of the hand.  She
had not expected it&mdash;nay, would have resented
it&mdash;but still the tone of indifference was painful
to her, although she was perfectly aware it was
assumed, and she answered in the same
commonplace tones:
</p>

<p>
"I am well, thank you."
</p>

<p>
And Hugh filled up the silence that followed
with his loud and hearty greetings.
</p>

<p>
"You will stay and have supper with us?"
said Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no!" interrupted Hugh; "I am going
to sup with him to-night.  I will ask Mari to
come and stay with thee."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Gwladys, "I would rather not.  I
have enough to do to fill up my time to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Wel, nos da, Mishtress," said Ivor; and he
and Hugh left, disappearing together through
the gloaming.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys looked after them with a set white
face, and then turned wearily up the stairs.
Calling to Madlen, she said, in a calm voice:
</p>

<p>
"When the Mishteer comes in, tell him I
was tired and went to bed."
</p>

<p>
On reaching her bedroom, she bolted the
door, and, falling on the bed, gave way to a
storm of tears.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hugh, Hugh!&mdash;my kind husband&mdash;oh! good
friend and true!&mdash;why has God brought
such sorrow upon thee?  But, no! he shall not
suffer&mdash;only me! only me!"
</p>

<p>
And then another flood of tears.  She rose
and went to the window, gazing silently at the
leaden waters of the bay, silvered here and there
by the moon, which was rising behind the
village; then in a whisper she said:
</p>

<p>
"Ivor, Ivor! didst feel it as I did?  Yes.  I
know by the tremble of his voice&mdash;'How are
you, Mishtress?'&mdash;'I am well, thank you.'  That
is all&mdash;and that is all that must be between us.
Ivor is strong and good&mdash;I must be the same!"  And
for the rest of the evening she lay still and
thoughtful.
</p>

<p>
And thus began Gwladys' martyrdom&mdash;and
no less that of Ivor's.  To meet in the ordinary
course of daily life, though not oftener than could
possibly be avoided, was a trial under which, at
first, both suffered acutely; and Gwladys drooped
and wilted visibly in the stress of the storm
through which she was passing.  She turned her
face daily towards the path of duty, endeavouring
to take up every thread of interest which her life
presented to her, and to brighten her husband's
path, even though her own had been stripped of
all beauty and joy; and gradually she earned the
reward of comparative calm and peace&mdash;a peace
which added a new charm to her beauty&mdash;so
much so, that the villagers often remarked&mdash;"Wel
wyr! the Mishtress grows prettier every
day."
</p>

<p>
Hugh rejoiced much in the cheerfulness which
she seemed to have somewhat regained.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis thy coming back, mach-geni," he would
say to Ivor sometimes.  "I put every good down
to that as I put every evil to thy going away."
</p>

<p>
And Ivor would push his hat further back on
his head, and attack his work with more vigour,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"I am glad, Mishteer, if it is so."
</p>

<p>
In the sail-shed, the work-people rejoiced to
have him once more amongst them&mdash;the same as
ever in his frank and genial manner, though much
changed in outward appearance; for it was
remarked by all how much his illness had aged him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, thee look'st ten years older, man!"
they said, with the usual outspokenness of the
peasantry.
</p>

<p>
And Ivor would only smile and say&mdash;"No
doubt, no doubt!" while he applied himself with
extra care and interest in the Mishteer's
concerns.  Morning, noon, and night he was busy,
apparently feeling that he could not do enough
for his friend.
</p>

<p>
And once more in the sail-shed could be heard
the swinging chorus of&mdash;
</p>

  "Torn sails and broken mast&mdash;<br />

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
HUGH'S SUSPICIONS.
</h3>

<p>
It was about this time that Gwen took to
wearing her shawl over her head, held tightly
with one hand under her chin, and appearing in
it at all sorts of odd times and places.  This, to
an outsider, may not seem an event worth
chronicling; but to anyone conversant with the inner
life of a Welsh coast village, it is full of meaning.
Where intermarriage is so common as it is there,
peculiarities of character gather strength with
every succeeding generation, and are affected by
the most trivial circumstances; and thus it comes
to pass that insanity is always lurking amongst
the seeming calmness and rural simplicity of the
village life, ever ready to pounce upon the
harassed in mind and body.  It is no uncommon
thing to see in a small village containing two or
three hundred inhabitants, two or three windows
boarded and barred, behind which are kept the
unhappy sufferers from this terrible fate.  The
dread of the asylum hangs like a cloud over the
scene that appears such a picture of rustic happiness.
The signs of increasing insanity are little
noticed by the villagers, it being considered
courteous to ignore them as long as possible, so that
the dreadful malady lurks about and shows itself
unexpectedly when it is too late to cure it.  One
sign which is quickly noted, though never
commented upon, is that of wearing the shawl in the
case of a woman over the head instead of the
shoulders, and the degree of insanity may be
often gauged by the manner in which the shawl
is held.
</p>

<p>
In case of a quarrel between man and wife,
or between two neighbours, the woman whose
temper has been most seriously ruffled appears
next day with her shawl over her head, and held
tightly under her chin, as a sign she is in no
humour for frivolous conversation; and the sign
is so interpreted by her friends and neighbours.
So that when Gwen carried her red pitcher to the
well in one hand, and with the other clutched her
grey shawl under her chin, every one knew the
death of her child was weighing sorely upon her,
and they passed her with a nod only, or a formal
"Dachi!"[<a id="chap10fn1text"></a><a href="#chap10fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p>
A few days later, the nod was not returned,
but Gwen looked straight before her with a glitter
in her eye and a set look on her lips which her
neighbours noted with a sigh.
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing! poor thing! she's very bad.
Lallo f√¢ch!  you must get Mari Vone in to chat
a bit and hearten her up!"
</p>

<p>
Lallo shook her head mournfully.
</p>

<p>
"I don't like it at all, Madlen f√¢ch.  She will
break her heart if she does not cry or something;
never a word day or night, but just that silent,
angry look.  Indeed, what should I do if it were
not for the pig?  But even with him she seems to
be offended!"
</p>

<p>
When, later on, Gwen not only appeared
invariably hooded by her grey shawl, but held that
shawl crossed over her mouth, she was observed
with more serious and sympathising looks.  A
woman who had quarrelled with her husband
would sometimes appear with a shawl held <i>under</i>
her chin; but few except the insane held their
shawl over the mouth, exhibiting only the nose
and eyes.  And as Gwen hurried through the
village or roamed about the cliffs, she was
followed by many a sigh and shake of the head.
The village children, against whom she directed
spiteful glances as she passed them on the shore
or on the cliffs, soon learned to fear and hate
her, and when she appeared amongst them they
would fly in all directions like a flock of sparrows.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, wyr!" said Sara Pentraeth, as she
looked after the miserable woman.  "Peggi
Sh√¢n has come back to Mwntseison, I think.
Ach y fi! she looks angry with the sun himself."
</p>

<p>
Her place in the sail-shed was often unoccupied,
and the Mishteer remarked upon it with reproof
as well as pity in his tone, when one day
she appeared, late in the afternoon, and sullenly
took her seat, and, after a few minutes' desultory
work, rose and began her way to the open doorway.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, Gwen!" he said kindly.  "What's the
matter, merch i?  Sorrow and hiraeth[<a id="chap10fn2text"></a><a href="#chap10fn2">2</a>] we can
all understand after such a loss; but what is the
meaning of that anger and sullenness?  Why,
lodes,[<a id="chap10fn3text"></a><a href="#chap10fn3">3</a>] art offended with the Almighty?"
</p>

<p>
"I am offended with you, Hugh Morgan! you
have no business to speak to me as if I was
a child, indeed, though you are the Mishteer."
</p>

<p>
"If you are a woman, Gwen, act like one, and
remember that sorrow, if properly borne, may
turn to a blessing."
</p>

<p>
"I want neither blessing nor cursing," said
Gwen, "but only to be let alone.  Go home, Hugh
Morgan, and attend to your own affairs; you will
find plenty to do with them," and she flung her
shawl over her head and left the shed.  Taking
no notice of the scared looks of her fellow-workers,
she walked homewards, straight and unbending,
and passed her much-enduring mother
in the cwrt without a word.  Lallo looked after
her sorrowfully, and went to the pig-stye door,
over which she leant in a musing attitude for
some time.
</p>

<p>
When the soft grey November days had commenced,
"Tewi du bach," or the "little black
weather," as it is called at Mwntseison, the sea
looked still and dreamy under its sheeny leaden
surface, and the land seemed to lie in a cold
swoon, for the summer and autumn were dead,
and the sharp winter weather had not arrived; it
was coming steadily and rapidly behind that grey
haze which looked so calm and innocent on the
north horizon of the bay.  The boats were
overhauled, and the nets were gathered in from the
stretchers.  As the evening shadows fell, over the
steely glitter of the sea there came a rippling
roughness, and an oily movement on the tide,
which told its tale to the watchful fishermen.
The doors of the sail-shed were closed, and down
the grey beach the boats were pushed into the
plashing waves; lights glimmered on the bay,
and every man in Mwntseison was full of interest
in the hauls of silver herrings which the boats
brought to land.
</p>

<p>
"Come home and sup with me, Ivor," said
Hugh, after one of their fishing excursions;
"thou art tired out."
</p>

<p>
"Man alive!" answered Ivor, "am I fit to
enter any clean house covered with tar and
herring-scales like this?  No, no, another time!"
</p>

<p>
"To-night it must be, or thou wilt offend
me," said Hugh.  "Go home and wash off thy
herring-scales, lad, for I know Gwladys has a
wheaten loaf and a fine lobster for supper; and
I'll take no more of thy 'no, no's.'"
</p>

<p>
"Well, I'll follow thee," said Ivor, seeing a
grave look in Hugh's face.
</p>

<p>
"I'll go and tell Gwladys thou art coming,"
said Hugh; and as he went up the uneven road,
carrying a string of herrings, he fell into a deep
study&mdash;one of those reveries which had become
rather frequent with him of late.
</p>

<p>
"What can be the matter with Ivor?" he
thought.  "What ails the man that he never
darkens my door?  I thought when once he
came back we should be always together; but no&mdash;it
is always 'not to-night, Hugh,' or 'another
time, Mishteer.'  I cannot make him out.  And
Gwladys, too! what ails her?  When I say 'I
will ask Ivor to come in to-night,' she never
seems glad, but turns away without a word.
Have they had any quarrel, I wonder? but
no!" and again a shadow fell over his face, and
an uneasiness crept into his mind, which
had hitherto been a stranger there; but he
chased it away as he entered the house and
handed the herring to Gwladys to be fried for
supper.
</p>

<p>
Ivor had tried so hard to put off his friend's
frequent offers of hospitality.  To-night he had
no choice but to accept.  When, cleaned and
brushed, he entered the cottage, he would have
given worlds to be able to rush away and hide
his eyes from the sight which he knew awaited
him there.  Yes, there she was, busying herself
with the arrangements of the simple supper, and,
in the fitful light of the blazing log fire, looking
more beautiful than ever, though paler and more
pensive.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, Mishtress, I hope you are well," said
Ivor, hurrying over the awkwardness of
meeting, while Hugh made him welcome with hearty
greeting.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys' answer was low and rather unsteady.
She set herself to her duties of hostess,
and endeavoured to enter naturally into the
conversation, but with very indifferent success, for
which Hugh suddenly called her to account.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, wyr!  Gwladys, Ivor will think he has
come at an inconvenient time if thou art so
thoughtful and silent.  Come, lass, sprack up a
bit, and give my friend a welcome, if thou hast
none for me."
</p>

<p>
Never before had she heard the slightest tone
of blame in her husband's words, and to-night the
overstrained courage gave way for a moment,
and her eyes filled with tears, while she offered
her poor little excuses; but she quickly
conquered her weakness.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Hugh, I am ashamed of myself; but
Ivor knows I have not been well lately, and he
will forgive me, and thou must, too."
</p>

<p>
"Why, of course, of course, merch i; I only
want to see the smiles and roses come back to thy
pretty face," and Hugh, as if trying to make
amends for his slight tone of reproach, passed
his arm round her waist, and drew her playfully
towards Ivor.  "Here she is, Ivor.  Doesn't
look as if we could be very angry with her, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys drooped her head shyly, though she
tried to join in Hugh's merry laugh, while Ivor
felt the blood rush to his head, and every pulse
in his body beating painfully.
</p>

<p>
When they were at last seated at supper,
Gwladys talked and laughed with unnatural
excitement, her eyes gleaming, and her cheeks
burning with even more than the old richness of
colour.  Suddenly a little sound or movement
drew their eyes to the doorway, and there in the
gloom stood a grey figure, silent, and with
glittering eyes fixed upon the trio at the table.
</p>

<p>
"Ach y fi!  Gwen, is it thee, then?  Indeed,
this is the second fright thou hast given me
to-day.  Wilt sit down to supper?" said Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
But Gwen only shook her head, and, pointing
to Hugh, went into peals of laughter&mdash;laughter
which they continued to hear as she left the
house, and took her way homewards.
</p>

<p>
Hugh shuddered.
</p>

<p>
"I believe she's crazy," he said.  "That
laugh did not sound like that of a sane woman;
and, since she has taken to wear that grey
shawl over her head, she looks the image of her
old grandmother.  I believe it's the very shawl
old Peggi Sh√¢n used to wear.  No wonder the
children call after her, 'Avaunt, witch!'  I feel
inclined to say the same myself."
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed, she frightens me often," said
Gwladys.  "In the garden or here by the fire, or
leaning over the brewing tub, I look up, and
there she stands, saying nothing, but just staring,
staring at me; and her eyes seem to pierce me
through and through."
</p>

<p>
"She has been distraught ever since her child
died, I think," said Ivor; "but we must see to
her.  She must not trouble the Mishtress in this
way."
</p>

<p>
With the pardonable pride of a middle-aged
husband, Hugh again drew Gwladys forward,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"No, no, she sha'n't be troubled by anything!
The best little woman that ever trod the sands of
Mwntseison, in spite of her silent ways sometimes.
Eh, Ivor?"
</p>

<p>
The latter felt he was expected to make some
reply, while Gwladys stood flushed and
perturbed before him.  His lips were dry and
parched, and his generally pleasant voice sounded
harsh and hoarse as he answered:
</p>

<p>
"Wel, everybody knows that you picked the
flower of Mwntseison; and everybody knows
too, that only you, Mishteer, are worthy of her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, halt there, lad, halt there!  I think
sometimes I have stolen her from a better man,"
and, as he loosened his arm from her waist, and
seated himself at the supper table, a serious look
came over his face, and a shadow seemed to have
fallen upon his spirits.  He had scarcely meant
anything by his words; but even while he spoke
there came to his mind a dim foreboding, and
to his heart a sharp suspicion, of he knew not
what, for he had not failed to notice the change
in Ivor's manner&mdash;the difficulty with which he
had brought out his words,&mdash;and, turning to
look at Gwladys, he felt that those downcast eyes
and that troubled face were not the signs of a
young wife's pride in her husband's tender touch
and admiring praises.  But he smothered the
feeling, and applied himself to his supper, and the
meal was gone through with some outward show
of hilarity.  Having finished, Hugh pushed the
brown jug of ale towards his friend.  "Wilt
drink, lad?" he said.  "Wilt drink to my health
and Gwladys'?"
</p>

<p>
"I will keep to the meth,"[<a id="chap10fn4text"></a><a href="#chap10fn4">4</a>] answered Ivor;
"'tis the best I ever drank; it still tastes of the
wild thyme and the sweet brier.  Mishtress! here's
to your good health and the Mishteer's,
and long life and happiness to you both!"
</p>

<p>
There was a strange light in his eyes, as he
stood with his head thrown back, the glass of
meth in his hand, and as he drank down its
contents, a deadly paleness spread over his face.
Sitting down again he drew a long breath, and
his hand trembled visibly as he replaced the glass
on the table.
</p>

<p>
"Canst thank him, Gwladys?" asked Hugh,
looking keenly at his wife, who shook her head
with a smile on her lips which looked unnatural
and strained.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will, then!  Ivor, they are fair <i>words</i>,
none could be better, and I thank thee for <i>them</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Words!" said Ivor, starting to his feet, and
stretching out his hand across the table, "Hugh
Morgan! there are no words which could ever
make plain my friendship for thee.  Health and
happiness to thee and thy sweet wife!  God
knows I would gladly shed my blood to bring it
to thee!"
</p>

<p>
"Good, then!" said Hugh, taking his hand;
"there's no more to be said.  Art going?  Well,
it is late, I suppose.  Nos da!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and a storm is rising.  Nos da,
Mishtress," said Ivor as he left the house.
</p>

<p>
It was true the storm was rising fast, dark
clouds scudded over the moon, the wind moaned
and wailed round the cliffs, the sea seemed to
swell and lash itself into threatening fury, and
Ivor felt the tumult of the elements accorded
well with his feelings.
</p>

<p>
"Dear God!" he exclaimed, as he made his
way through the buffeting wind, "I can never go
through that again&mdash;never! never! not even to
please thee, Hugh Morgan."
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in the cottage, Gwladys was clearing
away the remains of the supper, and endeavouring
by busy employment to cover the distressing
awkwardness which her husband's manner
had awoke in her.  As she passed him sitting
thoughtful under the chimney, he rose, and
drawing her towards him, held her face between his
two hands, and, gazing steadily at her:
</p>

<p>
"Dost hide any secret from me behind those
brown eyes?" he asked, in a serious, tender tone;
and before his honest black eyes her own quailed,
and a deep crimson flooded her face.
</p>

<p>
Hugh slowly drew away his hands with a
heavy sigh, without waiting for an answer.
</p>

<p>
All next day the storm gradually increased,
with a sullen persistency which seemed to
threaten a more furious outburst for its tardy
consummation.  The wind soughed up the valley in
fitful gusts; the sea seemed swelling with
repressed anger.  There was a heavy stillness in
the air, in strange contrast with the flying clouds
which passed at a high altitude from the
north-west.  Every cottage door was closed, the boats
were safely moored, and the geese on the upland
farms flew with loud cackling in flocks from one
stubble field to another.
</p>

<p>
At the door of the sail-shed Hugh Morgan
stood, lost in thought; the stormy atmosphere
around him accorded well with the deep unrest
which had taken possession of him.  The dark
suspicion which had darted into his mind on the
previous evening had, with the suddenness of a
flash of lightning, disclosed to him a truth,
which, if it had ever before dawned upon his
mind, had lain dormant, soothed to sleep by
Gwladys' gentle ways and his own mad infatuation.
</p>

<p>
He and Ivor had met at intervals as usual in
the course of the day's work, and each had felt
that an undefined shadow had fallen between
them; and of the two, Ivor had suffered most.
He was conscious that in Hugh's mind had awoke
a suspicion that he could never allay without a
lie, for deep in his own heart he knew that his
love for Gwladys was unquenchable and eternal.
It was so with him, and nothing could alter the
unhappy truth; he knew it, and he knew now
that his friend knew it; but there was another
thing that Hugh did not know, and Ivor writhed
under the impossibility of making clear to him
the depth and reality of his own unswerving
devotion to his friend.  As he had tramped home the
night before, he had evolved out of the turmoil
of his thoughts one idea, which he clung to with
some gleam of comfort; he must leave Mwntseison;
he must part from Hugh Morgan; he
must escape from the sight of Gwladys.  He
would close with the offer made him by Robert
Rees, the miller.  At Traeth-Berwen the old mill
was to be let, as Robert had become wealthy and
portly and lazy, and had offered to sell his
business on very generous terms to Ivor Parry.
Yes! he would take the old mill, and pass the rest of
his days in the dreamy little valley.  True, it was
only a mile away, and he would still see Gwladys
and Hugh on Sunday at Brynseion Chapel; and,
moreover, perhaps she would come to the mill
sometimes with the corn to be ground; but that
would be better than seeing her every day.  A
sudden sharp stab is better than a continual
probing! and he had seized a moment of respite from
work to rush down to "The Ship," to catch Robert,
and to settle the bargain with a slap of the
hand and a blue of ale, and for the rest of the
day he had felt somewhat less perturbed.
</p>

<p>
To Hugh, on the contrary, life seemed to hold
out no loophole of escape from the miserable
dread which had dawned upon him.  At first he
had been filled with a dull aching anger that
another man should dare to love his wife; and that
man his friend, whom he had trusted&mdash;whom he
had loved as a brother; and that he, Hugh
Morgan, who had always been considered, and who
thought himself, too calm and deliberate to be
deceived, should thus have made a mistake in the
most important step in his life!  There was no
anger against Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"Poor child! poor child!" he was thinking,
as he stood there at the door, with his hands
clasped behind him; "it was not her fault; I see
it all now.  She never loved me&mdash;she loved Ivor;
and I, fool that I was, thought my own love was
enough, and would arouse the same feelings in
her; but&mdash;thou hast been a fool, Hugh Morgan,
and thou must open thine eyes now to thy folly,
and make the best of a bad bargain.  Well, this
will help me to make up my mind on one point.
I will leave the sail-shed, I will give up my
business; I have enough and to spare, and poor
Gwladys shall not be left so much alone."  And
he looked down the village road with gloomy
forebodings in his dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
At this moment a large bunch of greenery
came round the corner of the shed, and stooping
under it, and looking through the golden and
green leaves came Mari Vone, her shapely arms,
crossed over her bosom, held the restraining
cords which bound her bundle of bracken on her
shoulders.  Her brick-red petticoat made a spot
of brightness in the gloomy landscape, and as she
approached Hugh, her blue eyes looking out
between the overshadowing ferns like harebells in
the grass, even his sad face lightened as he met
the sunny smile in the eyes, and marked the
perfect lips and the dimpled cleft in the chin.
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb!  Mari, where'st been through
the storm?" he asked, leaving the shed door,
and accompanying her up the village road.
</p>

<p>
"Wel wyr!  Now, thou'st never guess, Hugh.
'N'wncwl Jos had to go to Caer Madoc to-day to
receive his pension, storm or no storm, so he
borrowed Peggi Pentraeth's donkey-cart, and he
does whip the poor donkey so.  I hid the whip
in the big furze bush by our house; but, oh, dir
anwl!  I couldn't hide his wooden leg, so I'm
afraid he will use that instead.  No, no!  I will
not loosen my bundle, so let it be.  'Tis a bed
for the poor donkey to-night; I gathered it above
Traeth-y-daran, for I knew the poor creature
would be tired.  Here's Peggi's donkey shed;
wilt wait while I spread his bed for him?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay, I will come and help thee, lass."  And
in the little shed they spread the sweet fresh litter
in readiness for the weary beast.
</p>

<p>
"Always comforting some poor, weary creature,
thou art, Mari; 'twill be me next, lass.  Hast
any salve for a miserable man?"
</p>

<p>
"Hugh," said Mari, instinctively pressing her
hand to her side, "what is it?  Gwladys&mdash;is she
ill?"
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;what am I saying?  Yes, she is sick&mdash;I
am sick!  Come home, lass, and let me tell
thee."
</p>

<p>
And when they had strewn the litter of crisp
bracken they went out together, and reaching
her cottage door, Mari went in, Hugh following
in silence.  She pushed the rush chair towards
him without speaking; and, leaning his elbow on
the table, with his hands shading his eyes, he
unburdened his mind to the ear which had never
failed to listen with interest to every word that
came from his lips.  It was not a long story.  A
very few words served to reveal the dismal
tale&mdash;alas, too common&mdash;of disappointed hopes and
dire misgivings; of ruined happiness in two
hearts caused by one foolish step.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh, bringing his fist down
heavily on the table, "I have been a fool,
Mari&mdash;a blinded, headstrong fool!  Had I been a
boy, or even a young man like&mdash;like Ivor, there
might have been some excuse for me; but a man
of my age, one who had lived so long in quiet
and wise solitude, and especially a man who had
Mari Vone for his friend!  Why didst not say to
me," and he grasped her wrist fiercely, "'Stop,
stop, Hugh, for she loves another'?  <i>That</i> would
have been real friendship, such as I thought thou
hadst for me; but it seems I was wrong there
too.  I was mistaken in everything."
</p>

<p>
"I didn't know it, Hugh; indeed, I didn't
know it!"
</p>

<p>
"Didst not?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed!" and the tears welled up into
her eyes; but she resolutely kept them in check
while she answered, "Hugh b√¢ch, I am grieving
for thee; but there are two things thou canst be
certain of in all this sea of trouble&mdash;my true and
firm friendship, and that sweet Gwladys is as pure
as an angel."
</p>

<p>
To this Hugh made no answer, but continued
for some time brooding darkly, while Mari
sought in vain for any words that might
comfort him.  At last he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"I am getting tired of my life, Mari&mdash;tired of
myself.  Everything seems wrong with me, and
I feel like the outside world around me these
days, full of suppressed storm and unrest.  It is
not only Gwladys' want of love for me, not only
that; but I myself am wrong.  I am dissatisfied
with myself.  Come, guardian angel, and tell me
what to do!"
</p>

<p>
"What is it, Hugh b√¢ch?" said Mari, standing
tall and fair beside him, and looking down
with eyes of love and pity upon the storm-tossed
man, who sat with his elbow leaning on the table,
and his hands shading his troubled eyes.
</p>

<p>
"No! 'tis not Gwladys only who does not
love, but I myself have changed.  I, who thought
my love for her was unchangeable and true, have
awoke to find it was only a tempestuous passion
which laid hold of me and carried me away, until
I was cast shipwrecked and torn and broken
against the rocks.  Wilt despise me, Mari, when
I tell thee that Hugh Morgan, who thought he
loved his young wife, has ceased to do so?  At
the first dawn of suspicion, his love died out.
Pity, deep pity, and the tender love of a father
for his child, or an elder brother for his sister&mdash;that
I still feel; but the passionate ardour with
which I began my married life is gone&mdash;died
suddenly, Mari&mdash;never to live again.  Thou art
silent, lass, because thou art sorry to hurt thine old
friend by telling him how thou despisest him."
</p>

<p>
Mari laid her hand gently on his bowed head.
Her heart was strangely moved within her; she
would have been more than human had she felt
no joy at hearing that the love which she had
craved for all her life&mdash;if not hers&mdash;was, at all
events, not another's!  But the strongest feelings
that prompted her words were sympathy for
him and for Gwladys, and an earnest longing to
comfort them.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art altogether wrong, Hugh; I do not
despise thee, but pity thee, and sympathise&mdash;oh! with
my whole heart.  Thou hast not ceased to
care for thy wife; it is only the passion, the
earthly part of thy love, that has died out.  The best
part, the enduring, wise love remains, and will
remain for ever, to guard sweet Gwladys&mdash;to
comfort her and to guide her; for after all, Hugh,
she is but a child, and thou must be very gentle
and patient with her.  I am as fond of her as if
she were my own sister."
</p>

<p>
"Keep close to her, Mari f√¢ch!" said Hugh,
rising, "for she will need all thy tenderness&mdash;and
I, too, Mari," and he held out his brown hand.
"Don't turn me out of thine heart."
</p>

<p>
She took his hand in both her own, and
pressed it in a warm clasp.
</p>

<p>
"Never, Hugh! while life shall last!"
</p>

<p>
"Right, merch i!" was all Hugh's answer, as
he stooped his head under the low doorway.  He
turned back for a moment, while she still stood
pensive at the table.  "The old spar is drifting
amongst the waves at present, Mari; thou must
help to guide it into calm waters."
</p>

<p>
She looked up from the finger with which she
had been absently writing on the table.
</p>

<p>
"I will, Hugh!  Galon wrth galon!"[<a id="chap10fn5text"></a><a href="#chap10fn5">5</a>]
</p>

<p>
When Hugh returned to the sail-shed it was
to hear the astonishing news that Ivor Parry was
about to break off his connection with the
sail-making, and to enter upon the less arduous duties
of a miller's life.
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed," said Hugh, with forced cheerfulness,
"this will be a day to be remembered by
the gossips, for I, too, have a piece of news to
give you."  And raising his voice a little, so that
everyone in the shed could hear him, he continued,
"I meant to have called a meeting this evening
to let you know that I am thinking to give
up my business; but as Ivor Parry has already
fired the pistol, I need not be afraid to let off the
gun!  Joshua Howels and I have had many
talks on the subject, and I have now made up my
mind to give up the sail-shed to him.  I have
made enough money to keep my wife and myself
in comfort as long as we two live, and therefore
I will not stand in the way of another man's
doing the same thing.  Now, I want you not to
make any remarks about this to me to-night.
You know I am one of those foolish creatures
who cannot spend the greater part of every day
under the same roof with other people without
letting them into his heart, and I don't want you
to think little of me at the last.  So, anwl frindiau,[<a id="chap10fn6text"></a><a href="#chap10fn6">6</a>]
let us go on quietly, until some evening I
slip out silently after work, and Joshua Howels
comes in next morning instead of me.  We need
not say good-bye, as I am not going away from
Mwntseison, and I have no doubt that, whenever
I have an hour to spare, my feet will turn naturally
towards the old sail-shed, so that we shall
meet often; only, I will not be the Mishteer any
longer."
</p>

<p>
Here his voice was drowned by an uproar of
voices, and cries of "Mishteer!  Mishteer!" filled
the air.
</p>

<p>
"There has never been another Mishteer in
Mwntseison," cried somebody in the crowd, "and
there can never be another!"
</p>

<p>
The warm Welsh hearts of his work-people
were touched to the quick by his evident
emotion at parting with them.  When they saw him
reach down his straw hat, and turn towards the
little office opening out of the shed, and they
realised the meaning of the speech, a hush fell upon
them more eloquent than words.
</p>

<p>
The Mishteer was unstrung.  He was
sorrowing at parting with them.  There was a
moisture in his eyes, the tears were not far off&mdash;and
all for them; and as they dropped their voices, and
passed silently out through the big doors, Hugh
Morgan had never been so completely master of
their hearts.
</p>

<p>
Of course, next day Mwntseison was moved
from hearth to roof&mdash;from the Methodist chapel
on the cliffs to the little church on the top of the
hill.  Over the whole neighbourhood the news
was spread abroad, and amongst others, Nell
Jones and Sara Pentraeth had met early to
exchange ideas.  Their washing had been hurried
over in a very perfunctory manner, in the desire
to reach the "hanging-out" stage of the
proceedings; and as good luck would have it, just
as Nell began to spread out her heavy Welsh
flannels, Sara came out too with her basket, and
they were soon engaged in deep conversation
over the low hedge of blackened broom bushes
which divided their sandy gardens.
</p>

<p>
"Nell f√¢ch, didst ever hear of such a thing?
There's news! there's an odd thing! that the
Mishteer should change his mind like that&mdash;and
all of a sudden, too!  And, Nell anwl, to be
handed over to Josh Howels like a bowl of cawl!  Ach
y fi!"
</p>

<p>
"Will he pay us as well? that's the thing!"
said Nell; "for I've heard tell he's a man who
wants the penny and the pen'orth!"
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps indeed! shouldn't wonder; he is
nearly related to his father, and we all know what
he was!  But there's one good thing, we sha'n't
have to call Gwladys 'Mishtress' any more&mdash;Mishtress
indeed! with her airs and her pride.
Ach y fi! shoes, if you please, instead of clocs!"
and, with another expressive "ach y fi," she flung
a garment over the hedge so roughly as to tear
it, thus adding to her own irritation.  "Madam's
pride will come down now, Nell f√¢ch; for two
women, whose grandfathers and great-grandfathers
have lived at Mwntseison, to have to say
Mishtress to Nani Price's daughter is very hard;
for who was Nani Price's father, I should like to
know?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know," said Nell.  "What does
that matter? and, indeed, I can't say I have seen
any pride in the Mishtress."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, dir anwl!" said Sara spitefully, "who
could show pride to a poor, humble creature like
thee.  I have seen how thou hast flattered and
fawned upon her; but I don't think thy porridge
will be any the thicker for it.  As for me, I never
cringe to anyone.  I can hold up my head with
anyone in the village.  My father was never
suspected of sheep-stealing, and my uncle's wife's
brother never had occasion to keep accounts to
satisfy his master.  No! nor my mother never
promised to make a quilt for four shillings, and
then charge six shillings for it!"
</p>

<p>
This last thrust, alluding to something that
was within Nell's memories, was unbearable.
</p>

<p>
"Dost dare to say that my father stole
sheep?" she said, with arms akimbo, and looking
with flashing eyes across the broom hedge.
"Dost dare to say my uncle's wife's brother stole
his master's money?  I'll have the law upon thee
as sure as&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"The law!" said Sara.  "I defy the law, and
thee into the bargain!  I never <i>said</i> thy father
stole a sheep.  I only said <i>my</i> father never did.
No! and I'll tell thee another thing&mdash;<i>my</i> daughter
never tripped on her way to the marriage
market!"
</p>

<p>
At this last shaft, poor Nell was completely
crushed, and finished spreading out her flannels
in silence, while Sara retired up the garden with
flying colours.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
THE STORM.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Wild waves, where are you flowing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out on the seething bay?<br />
  Wild wind, what are you doing<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tearing the sea and tossing the spray?<br />
  There the storm bells are pealing,<br />
  There the sea-gulls are wheeling,<br />
  And the cabin-boy kneeling,<br />
  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Out on the seething bay."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next day the storm, which had threatened
Mwntseison for days, was at its height.
During the night the wind had increased into a
furious gale, lashing the foaming waves up the
sides of the cliffs, rushing up the narrow valley,
and carrying huge lumps of foam into the fields
above the village.  Lying awake, Gwladys
listened, dry-eyed, to the roar of the sea and the
shriek of the wind.  Every hour since that
critical moment when Hugh had looked into her
eyes, and they had quailed before his, seemed
to bring but an access of misery to her heart.
Her husband's tenderness had not failed&mdash;indeed,
the tones of his voice were even more gentle than
before; but she was too conscious of a subtle
change, the cause of which she knew too well.
Hugh no longer trusted her&mdash;no longer loved
her!  He was as fully aware of the state of her
feelings towards Ivor as though she had told
him in plain words, "I love him, and I have
never loved thee as I ought."  Oh, the pity of
it! that she could not fling her arms about his neck
and say, "Hugh, it is not true; it is a foolish
fancy of thine!  I love thee with all my heart,"
and, as she looked at Hugh's sleeping form
beside her, she would have given worlds to be able
thus to reassure him&mdash;but she could not.  He
tossed restlessly on his pillow, and she listened to
his mutterings.
</p>

<p>
"What shall I do, Mari?" he murmured, in
his sleep.  And Gwladys knew that in the bitterness
of his heart he was seeking comfort from
Mari Vone.
</p>

<p>
When the morning broke, she rose, listless
and weary, and, leaving Hugh still sleeping, went
downstairs and busied herself with the preparations
for breakfast.  As she drew back the wooden
bolt of the house door, it was pushed open
from without, and Gwen came into the passage,
as usual wrapped in her grey shawl.  She looked
pale and haggard, and her eyes gleamed fiercely
as she brushed roughly past Gwladys, and preceded
her into the kitchen.  She seated herself
on the settle under the chimney, where Madlen
was kindling the fire.
</p>

<p>
"Thou art up early to-day, Gwen," said
Gwladys, a little trembling in her voice, for a
restless night had already shaken her nerves.
"Wilt stay for breakfast with us?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, no; of course not!  I have breakfast
at home, and want none of thy charity.  Where's
the Mishteer?"
</p>

<p>
"He's still sleeping.  Dost want to see him?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, let him sleep," said Gwen; "he will
awake some day."  And her eyes, small and
glittering as a snake's, followed Gwladys as she
busied herself with her household duties.
</p>

<p>
She tried to throw off the fascination of
Gwen's look, but wherever she went she felt
oppressed by that basilisk stare.
</p>

<p>
"What makes thee so pale and downcast?"
Gwen said at last.  "Everyone thought that when
thou wert the wife of Hugh Morgan thou wouldst
be the brightest and happiest in Mwntseison; but
instead of that thou look'st like a white
storm-driven pigeon.  Come out in the rain with me;
'twill suit thee better than all these comforts.
Has Hugh Morgan begun to repent of his bargain yet?"
</p>

<p>
"What dost mean?" said Madlen, standing
before her with arms akimbo, "coming here,
indeed, to insult the Mishtress before she's had a
bit or a sup inside her?  Get thee out, Gwen, if
thee hasn't pleasanter words in thy tongue."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I am going," said Gwen, standing up
and backing gradually towards the doorway, with
her eyes still fixed on Gwladys, who felt frightened
and trembling, "out in the wind and rain.
'Tis a br√¢f morning."  And with one of her long
uncanny peals of laughter, she left the house, and
Madlen bolted the door.
</p>

<p>
"There," she said, with satisfaction, "let her
go to her wind and rain.  Tan i marw![<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>]  I'm
afraid of her."
</p>

<p>
When Hugh came down, he entered upon the
subject of his intended retirement from business.
</p>

<p>
"'Twill be better for thee, merch i," he said,
"than being so much alone.  Perhaps I have
been wrong to leave thee here all day to fret
thyself.  I will try not to be in the way of the
household work, Gwladys."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hugh," said the girl, her voice trembling
with emotion, "thou hast not left me to
fret.  Thou hast filled my life with kindness;
thou hast been everything to me&mdash;husband,
friend, brother,&mdash;and I will try&mdash;oh, I will try!&mdash;to
be all I can to thee.  Have patience with me,
Hugh."  And, with timid attempts at reconciliation,
she surrounded him with little nameless attentions,
piling his plate with the frizzled ham, cutting
thin slices of bread and butter from the long
barley loaf, and stooping herself to tie his shoe
strings; but Hugh's thoughts were absent, and
he took no notice of the little tendernesses.  The
cloud was on his brow and the dark shadow of
suspicion in his heart, and, though his words
were as kind, perhaps more so than ever, there
was an absence of the loving look and the warm
embrace, which cut his young wife to the quick.
After he had left the house, she flung herself
down in the rush chair in the chimney corner,
and, with her hands clasped listlessly on her lap,
she mused long and sorrowfully, making no answer
to Madlen's frequent allusions to the storm.
</p>

<p>
"There's yellow the sea is," said the latter,
peeping out through the little side window, which
looked down to the bay.  "All the sand in the
bay is mixed with it, and oh, anwl! the waves
are rising as high as steeples!  Wel wyr!"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys still sat on in a turmoil of miserable
thought.  What was to become of her?  How
should she bear the long life before her, always
mistrusted by her husband, and always fighting
with this terrible dear love for Ivor, which haunted
her sleeping or waking, in the garden, on the
shore, or at her household duties? and "I am so
young!  If I were old there would be some hope
of an end of it.  But so young&mdash;only twenty!
It is impossible!  I cannot bear it!" and in a
paroxysm of bitter trouble she started up, and,
flinging an old grey shawl over her head and
shoulders, she went quickly out through the back
door and into the sandy garden.  She would
battle with the wind and the storm!  It would
not be worse than the turmoil of thoughts within,
which made her heart ache and her head burn.
Out in the garden the wind almost took her
breath away.  The blackened broom bushes in
the low hedge which separated the garden from
the cliffs seemed to bend threateningly towards
her; but she pushed her way through them.  The
long grass, beaten down by the pelting rain,
obstructed her footsteps; but she hurried on
persistently, almost unconsciously, scarcely feeling
the cruel stings of the driving rain in her face,
and struggling with the fierce wind, which
clutched at her dripping garments and dragged
her backwards.
</p>

<p>
"But I will go!" cried the girl, as she fought
her way over the cliffs, sometimes stopping to
take breath, but again resolutely renewing her
battle with the storm.  Where was she going?
She knew not&mdash;cared not; but somewhere&mdash;anywhere&mdash;away
from herself and the pitiless circumstances
which pressed upon her!  Yes;
Gwen was right.  The storm and the wind and
the rain suited her better than the warm hearth
and the kind voice of her husband.
</p>

<p>
Could she reach Traeth-y-daran?  There she
would sit on the rock where Ivor and she had
spent their last hours together.  Perhaps there
she would find peace, for in vain she had sought
it in prayer and supplication.  She knew if she
were once able to make her way down the
dangerous path to the shore, the last step, which
would be of necessity a leap of ten feet, would
render a return impossible.  A dim perception
of this ran through her mind; but the frenzy
which had taken possession of her sought only
for its goal&mdash;oblivion, and a termination of her
sufferings.
</p>

<p>
In calmer moments she would not have dared
to tread that dangerous path in a high wind, but
to-day she seemed possessed by some wild spirit
of unrest, which drove her forwards and
impelled her flying feet on&mdash;on&mdash;till the edge of the
cliff was reached, and still on, down the dangerous,
zig-zag path, clinging to the stunted bushes.
Slipping, stumbling, and yet pursuing, she made
her difficult progress, and when the path ended
abruptly at the top of a smooth, perpendicular
rock, she did not hesitate for a moment, but took
the leap with streaming hair and swirling
garments, and alighting on the beach below, sped
onwards across the wet sands to where the low
rocks still lay uncovered by the in-coming tide.
At last she had reached her goal, and, flinging
herself down, she gave way to the tears which
she had hitherto restrained.  Every moment
seemed to add to the fury of the storm.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, wind, it is for me you are wailing and
shrieking!  Oh, rain, 'tis for me your tears are
falling!" and she mingled her own passionate
sobs and cries with the stormy sounds around
her.  Here she could cry aloud in her despair,
for there was no one to hear&mdash;no one but God.
"Does he hear me?" and she paused for a moment
and looked out at the boiling, seething cauldron
before her, and up to the streaming sky;
but her survey brought her no comfort.  "No,
He does not!  No! no!  I am alone&mdash;alone!"
</p>

<p>
At that moment a huge wave broke with
thundering force at a little distance from the
shore, and, helped by the wind and in-rushing
tide, it reached far up the beach, even to the
rock on which Gwladys sat; and for the first
time she realised that, in taking that flying leap,
she had cut herself off from every chance of
escape.  As she watched the huge, curling waves
rushing one after another towards her, a strange
joy rose within her.  She would be drowned!&mdash;and
here would end all the sorrow and all the sin
which had made the last three months of her
life so intolerable to her.
</p>

<p>
How had she dared to think God had not
heard her?&mdash;for here was the answer to her
prayers.  He was going to take her to Himself&mdash;to
calm her troubled breast and to unloose the
tangled skein of her life!  And leaning back, her
head on a bed of brown sea-weed, she set herself
to wait for death&mdash;the great consoler.  But when
the cold streams of water reached her, and,
encircling the rock, began to splash her face,
already wetted by the rain, she moved a little
further up the beach.
</p>

<p>
"Not just yet," she thought; "I must have
time to ask for pardon, and to say good-bye to
Ivor and dear Hugh!"
</p>

<p>
And again she threw herself back on the wet
sea-weed&mdash;as wet and sodden herself as was her
cold bed.
</p>

<p>
Steadily the tide came up&mdash;not slowly and
gracefully as in the quiet summer mornings and
evenings, but with rapid strides and far-reaching,
foaming arms, that seemed to stretch out
hungrily towards her.  She closed her eyes as the
drenching rain fell on her face, and with clasped
hands waited&mdash;but not for long.  For soon the
roar became louder, the wind blew more fiercely,
and once more she moved further up the beach,
until at last there was only a small strip of sand
under the cliffs left bare.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys rose, and wearily gained the narrow
strand, and, seeing that the swirling tide already
swept over it, she took her stand, leaning against
the rocky wall, and once more prepared to wait
her doom.  Suddenly there was a break in the
leaden sky, and while the waves now reached her
ankles, the drift widened, and the sun peeped out
and cast a fitful gleam on the tossing waves.  It
was only a gleam, but enough to waken in
Gwladys the natural instincts of youth, which had
slept within her lately.  After all, life was dear!
It was better to live miserable than to die miserable!
After all, life might hold some solution
of her perplexities; God might lighten her
burden&mdash;to Him nothing was impossible.  But it was
too late!  Already the water reached her knees,
and many a wave splashed even over her head.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in the sail-shed, Hugh and Ivor
worked each at his own special work, avoiding
each other as much as possible, but still showing
no other sign of disturbance.
</p>

<p>
"I see Captain Roberts at 'The Ship.'  Will
I go and tell him his sail is done, Mishteer?"
said Ivor at last, standing square and straight at
the door of the little office.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Hugh, "if thou canst get
there through the storm."
</p>

<p>
"Twt, twt," was all Ivor's answer as he tied
the ears of his cap under his chin.  In a few
minutes he had reached "The Ship" Inn, and
delivered his message, having done which he came
out again into the wind and rain.  From the
door of "The Ship" one could see over the
jutting point which hid Traeth-y-daran from the
rest of the shore; and Ivor, looking across the
stormy waters, seemed struck by something he
saw there.
</p>

<p>
Surely that was a human figure standing up
against the bare rock!  Yes, the grey form of a
woman!&mdash;Gwen, no doubt&mdash;and she would be
drowned for certain, unless he could save her.
A few moments he stood uncertain, until,
looking round him, he espied a man who slouched
up the road to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Will! is that thee, lad?  Wilt come
with me to Traeth-y-daran?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay!" shouted the man in return, for the
storm was too loud for the ordinary voice to be
heard.  He was one of those unfortunate
creatures so common along the coast&mdash;a harmless
idiot&mdash;a mental state politely described in the
neighbourhood as "not wise!"  He was always
ready to risk his life, of whose value he was but
dimly conscious.
</p>

<p>
Ivor knew it would be useless to ask
anyone else to dare with him the fury of that
boiling sea, "unless, indeed, Hugh was
here," he thought, as he pushed out his boat,
regardless of the entreaties of the knot of
idlers who had immediately gathered round
him.
</p>

<p>
"Here's the Mishteer!" said somebody, and
Hugh was hastily making his way through the
buffeting wind and spray.
</p>

<p>
"Come out, Will," he cried; "I will go."  And
laying hold of the boat, he prepared to leap
in, but was pushed back by Ivor.
</p>

<p>
"Not thee, Hugh.  Will and I are enough to
risk our lives on yon boiling pot.  Hast seen
the woman?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Hugh&mdash;"that mad Gwen in her
grey shawl."  And he still kept his hand on the
boat.  "Let me be, lad&mdash;I am not going to let
thee go alone."
</p>

<p>
"Back!" shouted Ivor, endeavouring to
spring past Hugh, who clutched at him and
struggled to leap in.  There was a moment's
wrestling between the two men, each heated by
his own passionate will and the new-born spirit
of antagonism between them, until at length,
"Remember thy wife!" cried Ivor; "I have no
one to leave behind&mdash;back, man!"  And with a
violent thrust, he flung Hugh splashing prone in
the shallow tide, and, springing into the boat, he
pushed it from the shore, while Hugh rose
angrily from his undignified position.
</p>

<p>
"Fool!" he cried, looking at the receding
boat; "he will be drowned, as sure as he's
there!"
</p>

<p>
"That's what he knows, Mishteer," cried a
man in the crowd.  "That's why he won't let
you go with him.  Tan i marw!  I think you
must both be tired of your lives!"
</p>

<p>
"As for me," said another, "I should say if
Gwen put herself into that pickle, let her come
out of it!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, man," said a third, "how can she get
out of it?  That wild sea before her, and a straight
rock as smooth as a wall behind her!"
</p>

<p>
"Twt, twt!" said the first speaker, "Peggi
Sh√¢n would come and help her!  There he goes
round the point, now he will be in the strame of
the storm!  Poor fellow&mdash;druan b√¢ch!"
</p>

<p>
"Druan a Gwen, too!" said the women.  "I
hope he will reach her."
</p>

<p>
"He will reach her safe enough," said Hugh;
"now that he has turned the point the tide will
be with him; but coming back will be the difficulty!"
</p>

<p>
And with straining eyes they watched for
the reappearance of the tiny craft.
</p>

<p>
"Where was the woman, Mishteer?"
</p>

<p>
"At the further end of the shore, standing
straight against the rock.  You can see her from
'The Ship' door; the tide must already have
been up to her knees, poor soul!  What frenzy
made her go to Traeth-y-daran of all places? for
she knew there was no returning from there!"
</p>

<p>
The rift in the clouds had grown larger, there
was a streak of blue sky and a stream of sunlight
shining through upon the troubled sea, and
suddenly round the point and in a patch of light the
boat appeared, labouring and tossing like a
cockle shell upon the stormy waters.  The sight
was greeted by a loud shout from the crowd,
which the roaring wind seemed to drive back into
their throats.
</p>

<p>
Hugh's relief was intense, as deep as had been
his terror, lest he might never see his friend again.
</p>

<p>
"God bless him!" he murmured, straining
his eyes eagerly, while the little boat rose and fell
between the billows; "there is Gwen in a grey
heap at his feet."
</p>

<p>
And shout after shout from the people welcomed
each appearance of the frail boat as it
rose from the trough of the sea.
</p>

<p>
Will and Ivor rowed bravely; but skill was
of little avail in such a storm.  They had reached
Traeth-y-daran in a lull of the wind, and,
sheltered a little by the encircling rocks, had not
found much difficulty in reaching the woman,
who stood apparently calmly waiting her doom
like a martyr at the stake.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys saw the boat approaching, and
quickly recognised Ivor as her rescuer; and her
blood, which had seemed frozen in her veins,
began once more to circulate; the heart which
had beaten so faintly bounded up, and fluttered
back to life; and the eyes, which had closed in
a last prayer, became suffused with warm tears.
</p>

<p>
As for Ivor, when, reaching the strand, he
became aware that it was Gwladys, and not
Gwen, whom he had come to deliver, he almost
dropped his oar in speechless horror.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys' tender form to be beaten by the
pelting rain and dashing spray!  Gwladys to be
there alone in peril!  What did it mean?"  And
sodden and wet as he was, a burning tide of heat
rushed through his frame, as a dim intuition of
the cause flashed into his mind; but there was no
time to ask, for he saw that upon recognising
him the strained courage was giving way.  A
huge wave rolled in and washed over her, and
in its backward flow bore the frail figure away
with it.
</p>

<p>
Ivor sprang into the tide as she was carried
past him, and, catching her in his arms, lifted
her safely into the boat, where she fell in a
crouching heap at his feet.
</p>

<p>
"Safe so far, thank God!" he said, and only
waiting to lift aside the dark brown hair which
covered her face, and to rest her head on a coil
of ropes, he bent at once to his oar, and turning
the prow of the boat round, he and Will strained
every nerve to reach the point, where they knew
their greatest danger lay, and where the tide and
wind together played havoc with the seething
waters.
</p>

<p>
The tide of life was already returning to
Gwladys' chilled body, for she was young, and
accustomed to Nature's various moods.  Not a
word passed between her and Ivor; his eyes
were fixed upon the sea, whose dangers he was
endeavouring to battle with&mdash;not for dear life
for himself, but for her who was dearer than life
itself.  Once only he looked at her.
</p>

<p>
"Art recovering, Mishtress?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," she answered faintly.
</p>

<p>
"Thank God!"
</p>

<p>
They relapsed into silence, for, even to hear
her faint answer, he had been obliged to stoop
close to her, so loud was the roar of the wind
and sea.  As they neared the point, even Will
became conscious of his danger.
</p>

<p>
"We'll drown, I think!" he shouted.
</p>

<p>
"But don't stop rowing," cried Ivor.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, it seemed impossible that such a tiny
craft should ever make its way in safety over
that rough sea.  The waves ran mountains high,
and each one, as it rolled in upon them,
threatened to engulf them.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys rose upon her knees sometimes, but
sank down again in terror at the sight which met
her gaze.
</p>

<p>
They had now reached the patch of sunlight
on the water, and the tide and wind helped them
onwards towards the beach.
</p>

<p>
Hugh watched them eagerly from the shore.
</p>

<p>
"Brave lad," he cried, "he will do it, I believe!"
</p>

<p>
At this moment somebody touched his arm,
and, turning, he beheld&mdash;Gwen, her grey shawl
over her head, and held over her mouth, her
small eyes gleaming fiercely at him.  She asked:
</p>

<p>
"What is this fuss about?"
</p>

<p>
Hugh gasped.
</p>

<p>
"Gwen!" he said.  "Mawredd anwl![<a id="chap11fn2text"></a><a href="#chap11fn2">2</a>] what
is the meaning of this?  Another of thy witch
ways!  Tell me, woman&mdash;art thou in that boat,
or here?  No more of thy mad tricks!"
</p>

<p>
"Mad tricks?" said Gwen fiercely.  "What
dost mean, Hugh Morgan?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, mad tricks," said Hugh angrily.
"Didn't I see thee half an hour ago on Traeth-y-daran,
with the waves dashing round thee? and
hasn't Ivor Parry ventured his life in that cockle
shell to save thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Mad, indeed!" replied Gwen, bringing her
white face close to his.  "Who is maddest&mdash;thee
or me, Hugh Morgan?  Dost think Ivor
Parry would risk his life to save me?  It was
not me who ran so wildly over the cliffs through
the wind and rain to-day.  I am not the only
one, I am glad to say, whose heart is burning
and aching.  Look nearer home, man.  If I am
mad, <i>I</i> never left the girl who loved me all her
life to marry a croten[<a id="chap11fn3text"></a><a href="#chap11fn3">3</a>] of a girl who did not
love me, and who loved somebody else.  'Tis
thou art mad, Hugh Morgan, and 'twas thy wife
Gwladys who ran through the storm to Traeth-y-daran
this morning," and she burst into one
of the long shrieking fits of laughter which had
latterly become the terror of Mwntseison.
</p>

<p>
Hugh looked at her in horrified amazement.
His mind was a chaos of troubled thoughts, and,
as a shout from the crowd caught his ear, he
turned again to watch the boat, but it was gone.
</p>

<p>
There had been a slight lull in the storm,
during which Will and Ivor had striven hard to
reach the shore; but the wind rose again, and
the sea, as if regretting its momentary gentleness,
suddenly increased in violence.  A monstrous
wave, towering higher than any that had hitherto
assailed them, came rolling with foaming crest
towards the boat.  Ivor and Gwladys realised at
the same moment that to escape its powerful
mass was impossible.  With one impulse they
stood up.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis death!" cried Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"But together!" answered Ivor, as he clasped
her in his arms; and together they were washed
out of the boat, and carried away by the rushing
wave.
</p>

<p>
Will struggled for a while to keep afloat but
soon sank, never to appear again.  The excitement
on the beach was intense.  They were now
aware that it was not Gwen for whom Ivor had
risked his life, for she was amongst them, and
they looked round to see who was missing.
</p>

<p>
In the seething, foaming inrush of waters, the
tossed and struggling figures clasped in each
other's arms were sometimes visible, rolling over
and over, but ever carried nearer to land.
</p>

<p>
"Where are they?" shouted Hugh Morgan.
"Show me, for heaven's sake, for I am blind and
mad, I think!"
</p>

<p>
"There, there, Mishteer," explained several
voices at once; "out there where the floating
buoy is fastened."
</p>

<p>
And Hugh, catching sight of the rolling
figures for a moment, dashed headlong into the
waves, in spite of the restraining hands of his
workmen, who thought he was going to certain
death.
</p>

<p>
"Mishteer, Mishteer! come back!" cried
'n'wncwl Jos; but Hugh did not hear.  Already
he was caught in the swirling waters, and the
old man, forgetting everything but his frenzied
fear for the Mishteer's life, dashed in after him,
but only to be caught on the crest of a thundering
wave, and to be rolled over and over like a
cork on the foaming waters.  The sea would
have none of them that day, the strong tide and
the fierce wind both setting landwards.
</p>

<p>
'N'wncwl Jos was quickly carried in far
enough for Dye Pentraeth to grasp him and drag
him into safety.
</p>

<p>
"Come up, thou old fool!" he said.  "Dost
think we can do without thee and thy wooden
leg?"
</p>

<p>
'N'wncwl Jos shook himself like a wet dog,
and would have rushed in again had he not seen
Hugh at that moment flung like a broken spar
on the beach.  He rose in a minute, and as he
rose he saw the forms of Ivor and Gwladys borne
in on a crest of a wave, and left upon the sands
almost at his feet.  They were at a little distance
from the small crowd, Gwen alone stooping with
Hugh over the sodden figures.
</p>

<p>
"Who is mad now?  Gwen or Hugh Morgan?"
she asked, in biting, sneering tones.  "Let
them alone, Mishteer,"&mdash;and she laid her hand
on his fingers, which were already endeavouring
to loosen the strong grip of the half-drowned
Ivor and Gwladys&mdash;"let them alone; 'tis as it
should be!" she added.
</p>

<p>
"Away, you devil!" cried Hugh, battling
with his bitter agony.  And Gwen left him with
one of her usual fits of laughter.
</p>

<p>
Hugh's fingers trembled visibly as he loosened
the coils of Gwladys' brown hair, which had
twisted round and round Ivor's face.
</p>

<p>
"The water is cold," he said apologetically,
and his trembling voice and chattering teeth
were accounted for; but when the long hair was
disentangled, and the clutching fingers loosened
from their frantic grasp, there were ejaculations
of horror and astonishment from the sympathising
onlookers.
</p>

<p>
"The Mishtress! howyr b√¢ch! how did she
get there?  Druan f√¢ch! there's white she is!
And Ivor, too!  Surely there will be no
awakening for him.  So still, so white! but
with a smile on his face.  Dost see it, Mari
f√¢ch?"
</p>

<p>
But Mari was busy with Gwladys.  Tenderly
the fragile form was carried up the road and into
her own home, while Ivor was borne with no less
loving care to his lodgings, where the proper
means of restoration were, before long, successful
in bringing him back to life, and the crowd
waiting outside turned up the road towards the
Mishteer's house.
</p>

<p>
"How did the Mishtress get there?"  was
now their eager question.
</p>

<p>
This seemed likely to remain an unsolved
mystery, for as Mari Vone came gently down
the stairs to answer their frequent inquiries, her
reassuring accounts of Gwladys' awakening and
recovery stopped short at this interesting point.
</p>

<p>
"Mari f√¢ch," said Sara Pentraeth, in a voice
made hoarse by the excitement of the morning,
"tell us, Mari f√¢ch, how did the Mishtress get
there?" and in her eagerness she ran up two or
three stairs, and reached with clawing fingers
towards Mari's skirts.
</p>

<p>
"She is better," said Mari, coming down the
stairs; "the Mishteer is with her, and begs you
all to go home quietly.  The Mishtress will be
well in a day or two; but she is too frightened
to answer any questions yet."
</p>

<p>
And, reluctantly, they were compelled to
control their curiosity for the present, satisfying
themselves by turning again towards Ivor's
lodgings, where they lingered about all day until
relieved by the information that his strong frame
was battling bravely for life, and that probably
after a night's sleep he would be himself again.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys had opened her eyes and returned
to consciousness with a quiet calmness which
was absent from Ivor's recovery.  The return of
life and warmth to the body which has so nearly
severed its connection with the soul is often a
painful experience, and especially in the case of
partial drowning.  He had returned to consciousness
with much struggling and groaning, and
when he realised that the old life of thwarted
hopes and bruised feelings had once more to be
encountered, the groans, which those around him
attributed to bodily pain, were caused by the
fresh awakening to mental anguish.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys! where is she?" were his first words.
</p>

<p>
"Safe at home, and getting right rapidly."
</p>

<p>
He said no more, but quietly seconded
the efforts of those around him to restore
him.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, Hugh Morgan sat silent and
thoughtful beside his young wife's bed, holding
her hand in one of his, while with the other he
occasionally smoothed away the brown locks,
which, in drying, resumed their tendency to curl
and wave about the snowy forehead, while Mari
Vone came and went with gentle words and
tender smiles.
</p>

<p>
"There's a good girl!" she said, as Gwladys
returned an empty cup of some steaming
concoction which she had swallowed in quiet
obedience.
</p>

<p>
The brown eyes looked up gratefully, but
there was no answering smile on the red lips.
Only when Mari had retired for a moment, she
raised Hugh's hand and pressed a silent kiss
upon it, and as she let it drop again, a tear rolled
down her cheek.  It caught Hugh's glance at
once, and, with almost womanly tenderness, he
wiped it away.  She opened her lips to speak,
but Hugh placed his finger playfully upon them,
saying:
</p>

<p>
"Not a word, merch i, until thou art well.
To-day and to-night thou must be quiet,
Dr. Hughes says, and to-morrow thou may'st talk
to thine heart's content."

CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
UNREST.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Pen addysg pan oeddwm, i'r gwyrdd-ddail mi gerddwn,<br />
  A'r man y dymunwn mi ganwn a'r gog;<br />
  Yn awr dan ryw geubren 'rwy'n nuchu ac yn ochen,<br />
  Fel clomen un adeu anwydog."<br />
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Time was when calm in wisdom's ways, with heart at rest,<br />
  I roamed the wood to hear the cuckoo sing;<br />
  But now I seek the shade alone, unblest,<br />
  And mourn&mdash;a shivering bird with broken wing."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"You must go to bed, Hugh," said Mari,
when the moon began to look in through the
little chamber window, where Gwladys lay quiet
and thoughtful.  "She has her mother with her,
and I will come down in the early morning and
make you a cup of tea; so get to bed&mdash;your eyes
look weary, and your hand is shaking.  A good
night's rest will be best for you.  I will take care
of Gwladys, f√¢ch."
</p>

<p>
"I know, I know," said Hugh; "you will be
a better nurse than me, so good-night, lass.  Can
diolch!"
</p>

<p>
He made his way to the little back attic, where
the tiny window looked out under the roof to the
rugged cliffs and brown hills stretching round
the edge of the bay.
</p>

<p>
Madlen, who slept in the corresponding room
in the loft, wondered what kept the Mishteer up
so late; for long after she had gone to bed, she
had heard him pacing up and down.  Mari had
left Gwladys under her mother's care, with a
mould candle for company, just to show any of
the villagers who might look that way that the
interest of the situation had not entirely
departed.  It was considered an imperative duty
at Mwntseison to keep a candle alight in any
room where there was sickness or death.
</p>

<p>
So Nani Price lighted her candle and placed
it near the window, where its modest glimmer
was frequently remarked upon during the night
by the sympathetic villagers.
</p>

<p>
"There's a light still in the Mishtress's
window," said Nell, pressing her nose against her
two-paned window&mdash;"a good light, too&mdash;a shop
candle, no doubt.  But the Mishteer can afford
it&mdash;or perhaps," she added, as she returned to
bed, "perhaps it is only a dip put close to the
blind!"
</p>

<p>
Sara Pentraeth was equally impressed as she
looked up the road at the glimmering light.
</p>

<p>
"Wel wyr!" she said, "they have lighted a
second candle&mdash;and shop candles, depend on it!
Dear, dear! there's nice it is to be rich!"
</p>

<p>
In the little room under the thatch, where
Hugh Morgan had retired for the night, there
was no candle or lamp, but it was flooded by a
stream of moonlight, which made a slanting path
across the rough, uneven floor.  Hugh crossed
and re-crossed it as he walked with folded arms
and bent head up and down&mdash;up and down until
the moon was high in the sky.  A rough wooden
bedstead and bed occupied one dark end of the
long, low room, which was otherwise destitute
of furniture, excepting a worm-eaten bench
which stood against the bare, white-washed wall.
At the further end, in the dark shadow, stood
two or three generations of spinning-wheels, in
various stages of decay, accompanied by a few
old cloaks and fishing-nets hanging over the
rough rafters.
</p>

<p>
Here Hugh Morgan set himself to face his
troubles and to fight with his angry feelings; and
if, when the morning dawned, he had neither
chased away the one nor conquered the other, he
had at least gained courage to meet them with
fortitude and patience.  Suddenly he started,
with his eyes fixed steadily on the further end of
the room&mdash;for there, in the shadow, stood Mari
Vone, her tall, graceful figure stooping forward
a little, one white arm hanging by her side, the
other raised and with finger pointing upwards,
seemed to remind him that though he sought in
vain for comfort on earth, from Heaven he might
still gather help and strength!  Her golden hair
was unbound, and hung, as he remembered it of
old, in flowing waves below her waist; and as he
gazed earnestly into the darkness, her face, with
every feature and lineament distinctly marked,
appeared before him&mdash;the deep blue eyes, the
white eyelids that too often drooped over them,
the parted lips, the dimpled chin&mdash;all were
distinctly visible.  He did not stop to ask himself
how she had come there, but with the instinctive
relief which her presence always brought him, he
stretched out his hands with an exclamation of
greeting, and, stepping across the bar of moonlight
into the dark shadow, stood face to face
with&mdash;nothing!&mdash;nothing but the old spinning-wheels
and nets, and cloaks of different hues which hung
down beside them.  He stood baffled and astounded.
</p>

<p>
"Could these old rags have shaped themselves
in his imagination into Mari's beautiful
form?"
</p>

<p>
He returned to his seat on the bench, and
tried once more to recall the picture to his
mental vision&mdash;but in vain.  She was gone!  And
Hugh turned again to face his loneliness and
sorrow.  Curiously enough, as the night
advanced, his thoughts were withdrawn in a great
measure from Gwladys, and were occupied with
Mari Vone.  A sore feeling of resentment against
her took the place of the placid, contented
friendship which for so many years had reigned in his
heart.
</p>

<p>
"It was her fault," he thought&mdash;"all this
bitter trouble that had come upon him!  Everybody
in the village knew that she had jilted him
shamefully!  And what did that mad woman
mean?&mdash;'The girl who has loved you all her
life!'  But whatever she meant, it was some
fancy of her disordered brain!"
</p>

<p>
Mari Vone had injured him&mdash;had spoiled his
life, and had laid him open to the temptation of
a foolish headstrong passion&mdash;a passion that had
already died out within him like the furze
bush on yonder hillside that blazed up so
merrily when the farmer's boys lighted it to-night
at ten o'clock, and now see, scarcely a spark
remained.  So had his passion for Gwladys died
out within the last few days, and Mari Vone
had been the cause of all his mistakes and
troubles!  As for Gwladys, he bore her no
resentment.
</p>

<p>
"Poor child, poor child!" he thought; "it
has been no fault of hers!  I alone am to blame!
I was the Mishteer, and she dared not refuse me!
But Ivor&mdash;how has he repaid me?  But I will
watch and see that at least he shall not lead
Gwladys into mischief.  Could they have met
clandestinely?  But no! the thought was unworthy
of him or of her!  But yet&mdash;he would watch!
Yes&mdash;watch!"  And for the first time in his life
the giants of suspicion and jealousy clamoured
loud at the door of his heart.
</p>

<p>
But he showed no outward sign of disturbance
next morning when, rather late, he entered
Gwladys' room.  Mari Vone stood beside her,
and, leaning over the still pale invalid, raised one
finger to enforce silence; and the attitude
instantly reminded Hugh of the figure he had seen
by the old spinning wheels, and the feelings of
resentment which it had roused again took
possession of him.
</p>

<p>
"Hush!" said Mari, "she is sleeping!"
</p>

<p>
"That is all right," he answered, in a cold
and formal voice.  "I will see to my wife now,
Mari; and we need trouble you no longer."
</p>

<p>
Mari was conscious in every fibre of her
being of the change in his manner.  She flushed
visibly, but showed no intention of giving up
her post beside Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"I have promised Gwladys not to leave her
to-day; so have patience with me, Hugh, and
leave me here.  Your breakfast is waiting."
</p>

<p>
It was in his heart to thank her for all her
tenderness and affection for his unhappy wife;
but he hesitated, struggling with his new-born
anger, and, saying something about his breakfast,
left the room awkwardly; and Mari was
once more left to keep watch by the sleeping
girl-wife.  Downstairs in the living-room she had
carefully arranged Hugh's breakfast, and after
partaking of it silently, he once more entered his
wife's room.  She was now awake, and when he
appeared stretched both hands to meet him.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh b√¢ch!" she said, "come and sit by
me.  Wilt go out for a bit, Mari lass? or stay if
thee lik'st, for I have no secrets from thee."
</p>

<p>
But Mari, having first stooped down to kiss
her, slipped out of the room, and Hugh took the
chair which she had vacated.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys' breath came in short gasps, her
nervousness was painful to witness, and Hugh
was smitten with a deep pity for the girl whose
happiness he considered his mistaken passion
had wrecked.
</p>

<p>
"I want to tell you&mdash;&mdash;" she began, with dry
lips and fluttering breath.
</p>

<p>
"Thou shalt tell me nothing, child!  I know
it all.  Thou hast never loved me&mdash;thou hast
never loved me since we were wedded!  I have
wronged thee, Gwladys; I might have known a
young girl of thine age could not love a
middle-aged man like me!  But thou hast wronged me,
too&mdash;thou shouldst have told me this that night
when I went to thy mother to ask her for thee!
But not a word from anyone! no one thought it
worth while to stop me when they saw me rushing
to destruction like a blind horse who gallops
madly over the cliffs.  'Twas cruel! and I think
I would have stretched out my hand to save the
unhappy creature; but apparently Hugh Morgan
has no friends&mdash;not even Mari Vone called me
back!  Well, Gwladys merch i, we have both
made a mistake.  Now our eyes are open, and
we can only walk together to the end of our
lives side by side, each one trying to lighten the
sorrow of the other.  God only knows how it
is going to be, Gwladys f√¢ch; but that is the
path for us&mdash;it will be a dry and dusty one for us
both.  May it lead to the golden gates of the
West at sunset!"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys, with her face hidden in the pillow,
was sobbing bitterly.  Hugh let her cry for a
while, and then, drawing his hand tenderly over
the brown curls, asked, in a voice of much emotion:
</p>

<p>
"One question only I will ask, and that is,
Didst mean to do it?  Was it with clear purpose
that dreadful race over the cliffs&mdash;that leap on to
the sands below?  Oh, Gwladys, didst think of
it and settle it all while I was sleeping here
beside thee?  Wert so unhappy with me?  Didst
hate me so much, merch i, that the cold creeping
tide and the wind and rain were a haven of refuge?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no, no!" said Gwladys, rising on her
elbow, and looking at him with streaming eyes,
"that I can tell thee, at all events.  I did not
plan it beforehand; I was restless and wicked,
and I knew nothing till I was out in the blinding
rain; I felt nothing but wanting to get away
anywhere out of myself.  It seemed as if an evil
spirit had got hold of me.  Gwen had been here
in the early morning when I first came downstairs;
she had taunted me and sneered at me, and the
cruel look in those eyes of hers seemed to wake
some mad creature inside me; and I felt nothing
but on&mdash;on&mdash;until I had jumped down to the
sands.  Indeed, indeed, Hugh, that is the
truth!"
</p>

<p>
"Thank God for that," said Hugh.  "Cheer
up, merch i, we shall pass through life somehow;
and some day, I am sure, God will lighten thy
burden."
</p>

<p>
"Thy tenderness is wounding me sore, Hugh.
I have been a wicked girl, but try me once more.
Mari Vone has been with me since five o'clock,
and she has been trying to show me how I can
best find my way back to thine heart, and how I
can repay thee for all thy goodness to me.  Let
me get up&mdash;I am longing to begin, and thou
shalt see&mdash;oh! thou shalt see what a good and
true wife I can be!"
</p>

<p>
"Right, merch i, thou art on the right path
any way; and from henceforth try not to hate
me, lass&mdash;try to love me, as if I were thy father
or an elder brother.  Canst give me so much,
girl?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hugh!" said Gwladys, springing on to
the floor, and flinging her arms about his neck,
"I have always loved you so&mdash;fondly, dearly!"
</p>

<p>
He gently loosened the hands which were
clasped behind his neck, and still holding them
in his own, stooped and kissed her forehead
once&mdash;twice&mdash;three times&mdash;before he quietly left the
room.  He was on his way to the sail-shed when
he was accosted by Sara Pentraeth, who came
running madly down the hill to catch him,
carrying her wooden shoes in her hand, closely
followed by Nell.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mishteer! come back, come back!
Come to poor Lallo&mdash;she is calling for you!"
</p>

<p>
"Come, Mishteer b√¢ch!" said Nell.
</p>

<p>
"A dreadful thing has happened," said Sara.
"Oh, Mishteer b√¢ch! 'tis Gwen, the vilanes&mdash;she
has done a fearful thing&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
But Hugh was already out of hearing.  He
had turned at once, and with rapid strides was
shortening the distance between him and Lallo's
cottage.
</p>

<p>
As he approached it, he saw a crowd of villagers
gathered round the pig-stye, gazing with
exclamations of horror at something which lay
inside the enclosure.  Lallo, weeping bitterly,
made one of the crowd.  Gwen was nowhere to
be seen, being in reality hidden behind the
pig-stye, listening with a pleased smile to the
various comments of her neighbours.
</p>

<p>
Lallo's sympathising friends plied her alternately
with condolences and questions.  A stream
of blood ran from under the pig-stye door, and
trickled down the rocky road&mdash;inside, lying
prone on its side, was the pig, with a horrible
gash in its throat from which the life-blood was
still trickling.
</p>

<p>
"What is the meaning of this?" said Hugh,
looking down at the slaughtered animal.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Gwen!&mdash;Gwen did it, Mishteer, and
then walked quietly into the house, and put the
razor on the table!  Didn't she, Lallo?"
</p>

<p>
"She did, she did!" said Lallo, beginning to
cry afresh.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Lallo f√¢ch!" said Sara; "you
know you had settled to kill him next month."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but that's a very different thing.  To
die at the appointed time, and to be properly
salted and dried, every pig expects&mdash;but to be
hurried unprepared like this is terrible."
</p>

<p>
"But you can salt him and dry him," said
Nell, offering her mite of comfort.
</p>

<p>
"Can I, do you think?&mdash;oh! but I shall never
have the heart to do it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, be thankful," said an old crone who
had the reputation of being the wisest woman
in the village, "be thankful it is the pig and not
yourself who is lying there."
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;you couldn't be salted and dried,"
said 'n'wncwl Jos.
</p>

<p>
"Well, that's true enough," answered Lallo,
addressing Hugh Morgan.  "Mishteer b√¢ch, I
am in terror of my life&mdash;what will you advise
me to do?  If she could kill that poor pig
who never did her any harm, she may do the
same to me.  I have borne and borne, but I
can bear no more.  What shall I do, Mishteer
b√¢ch?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Hugh, "you must either have a
strong man to live with you, who can keep a
constant watch upon her, or you must send her to
the asylum&mdash;that is my advice.  Send her to the
asylum."
</p>

<p>
"My Gwen to the 'sayloom!" cried Lallo, in
angry tones.  "No, no, we have not fallen so low
as that!  My aunt was not wise the last years of
her life, but she died peacefully in her own bed,
and my cousin was a mad 'iolin,'[<a id="chap12fn1text"></a><a href="#chap12fn1">1</a>] but his
mother kept him respectably shut up in the penucha
for many years, and he died singing 'O, frynian
Caersalem!' like a saint.  No, no, my Gwen shall
not go to the 'sayloom!"
</p>

<p>
"What did you ask my advice for, woman, if
you will not take it?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mishteer, I did not expect <i>that</i> advice;
but I thought you would be able to tell me
what I am to do."  And she burst out into fresh
sobs, mingled with indignant exclamations.
"Ach y fi, no!  'Sayloom, indeed!  Howyr b√¢ch,
no!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Hugh, turning to leave the
crowd, "I have no more time to waste.  Get
Tim 'Twm' to cut up your pig properly and salt
it, and get Gwen to help you&mdash;it will keep her
from mischief&mdash;and by that time you will have
calmed down, and will be ready for my advice,
I expect.  That woman is a danger to us all," he
said to 'n'wncwl Jos, who stumped down the hill
beside him, "and I must get her put in an asylum
before another month is out."
</p>

<p>
"Must you, indeed!" said Gwen, suddenly
facing them.  She had glided from behind the
pig-stye, where she had listened to the whole
conversation, and followed close behind them down
the road, and now, suddenly passing them, turned
round facing them, and walking backwards, she
fixed her glittering eyes upon Hugh.  "Wilt
take me to the 'sayloom, Hugh Morgan?&mdash;perhaps
indeed!  But we shall see&mdash;we shall see!"  And
laughing wildly, she turned suddenly up a
path which led to the open cliffs.
</p>

<p>
"Tan y marw! 'tis Peggi Sh√¢n herself!" said
'n'wncwl Jos, who had not his usual cheerful
jollity.  In truth, the old man, in the excitement
caused by the events of the preceding day, and
in the absence of Mari's thoughtful care, had
entirely forgotten to change his dripping garments
until late in the evening.  He was accustomed to
think nothing of such a wetting, and had a score
of times braved its dangers; but to-day he
shivered, and indignantly confessed to himself that
he believed he had been such a fool as to catch
a cold like a babby!
</p>

<p>
"Art afraid of her?" said Hugh, noticing
his unusual quiet manner.  "I must see about
her, poor thing, for certain&mdash;as soon as I have
shifted my business on to Josh Howels.  I see no
safety for her or for us except the asylum."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, clap her in," said the old man.  "I
don't like the look of her eyes."
</p>

<p>
Ivor Parry, though looking pale and shaken,
had astonished everybody by appearing in the
sail-shed as usual in the morning, and when
Hugh entered was standing not far from the
open doorway.  An exchange of greetings was
unavoidable between them.
</p>

<p>
"A br√¢f day," said Ivor, looking up from a
sail which he was examining, "a br√¢f day, Mishteer,
and the end of the storm, I think.  I hope
the Mishtress has not suffered from her wetting."
</p>

<p>
"Not much," said Hugh, fixing grave eyes
upon his whilom friend.
</p>

<p>
Poor Ivor endeavoured to stand his scrutiny,
but, it must be confessed, with no great success.
</p>

<p>
"Not much," continued Hugh, "and I have
to thank you for risking your life to save hers.
Dear God! had I known it was my wife you
were going to save, you would not so easily have
overcome me and pushed me out of your boat."
</p>

<p>
"B'dsiwr, b'dsiwr!  I did not know myself it
was the Mishtress.  I thought it was Gwen, or I
would not have thrust you back.  You must
forgive me that, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
He was keenly conscious that, in addressing
him, Hugh had dropped the familiar "thee" and
"thou," and he fell at once into the more formal
manner himself.
</p>

<p>
"We would both have done the same for any woman."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad to see you have not suffered, and
I thank you again," said Hugh, with a slight
show of warmth.  He could not look into those
honest blue eyes and not trust them, but he could
not remember all he had learnt of late, and quite
believe.
</p>

<p>
The death of Lallo's pig was the subject of
conversation in the sail-shed that morning, and
Hugh was thankful that its racy horrors had the
effect of turning the gossip of the villagers from
his wife's narrow escape.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she is quite well, and none the worse for
her dip," he answered jovially to every one who
made inquiries.
</p>

<p>
"There's glad I am, indeed, indeed&mdash;she
might be drowned.  But, Mishteer, what shall
we do about Gwen, weaving in and out amongst
us?  Ach y fi! there's dangerous."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I am afraid she must go to the asylum
as soon as I have settled my affairs a little," said
Hugh, not sorry to add to the gruesomeness of
the incident, and to turn their thoughts away
from his wife.
</p>

<p>
"But how did the Mishtress get to Traeth-y-daran?"
said the wise woman of the village&mdash;"that's
what I want to know."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's but young, you know," said
Hugh, smiling indulgently, "and thoughtless like
all young things, and fancied she would like to
see the storm from Traeth-y-daran.  She might
have fared badly if Ivor Parry had not risked his
life so nobly.  I have given her a good
scolding."  And he laughed cheerfully.
</p>

<p>
"Did Ivor know it was the Mishtress?" said
the inquisitive wise woman.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, we both thought it was Gwen."
</p>

<p>
And so the incident was allowed to sink to
rest, to make room for the more exciting
adventures of Lallo's pig.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
DOUBTS AND FEARS.
</h3>

<p>
For some time after these events, a season of
outward calm seemed to reign over the Mishteer's
household.  Gwladys had taken her place in the
daily routine of life with courage and patience,
and, leaning upon Mari Vone's strength of
character, kept up the role of happy wife!  She
executed all her small duties with unswerving
exactitude, going out of her way to carry out the
most trivial details; every wifely duty was
performed with apparently cheerful alacrity, and her
demeanour was perfect in its simulation of
domestic happiness.  She almost deceived herself,
but there were moments when the gnawing giant
of unrest within her threatened to overwhelm her
new-born strength and earnestness of purpose.
She fought hard, and gained comparative peace.
At evening, when Mari left her, the long tremulous
pressure of her embrace alone expressed her
gratitude; but her friend knew well the sunken
rocks that underlay the seemingly smooth
current of life under Hugh Morgan's roof.
</p>

<p>
Truth to tell, the even flow of her own life
had been much disturbed of late, and though she
still attended to all her domestic duties with the
same stately calmness, it was not without a
feeling of sore trouble that she observed the change
in Hugh's manner.  Not only to her, but to all
around him, he appeared colder and more formal,
much absorbed in his own thoughts.
</p>

<p>
"Business, merch i!" he would explain sometimes,
when, with a serious wistfulness, Gwladys
timidly rallied him.
</p>

<p>
Mari had again fallen into her old habit of
leaving the house before Hugh returned from the
sail-shed in the evening, and as she always went
home before noon to prepare her uncle's cawl,
many days went by without her seeing Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Thou must stand alone now, Gwladys f√¢ch,"
she said one day, when her friend demurred
to her leaving her so early; "our house wants a
thorough clean-up.  I must white-wash the stone
at the garden gate, and put some fresh red paint
at the back of the big chimney, the smoke has
blackened it so."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I suppose I must," said Gwladys, "and
I shall have Hugh home soon to cheer me up&mdash;I
will be bright and nice, as thou art!  I have
learnt a great deal in the last few weeks, and it
has been all through thee, Mari f√¢ch! only, Mari,"
throwing away the stockings which she was knitting,
and clasping her knees, and looking up into
her face, if with less misery in her eyes, still with
a look of troubled thought, "only, I wish I was
not walking along my path so blindfolded.  I
dare not look to the right or left, but I keep
straight on, as thou hast advised me&mdash;to try and
make Hugh happy! try and make Hugh happy!
Nothing else in my life, Mari; the last thing at
night and the first thing in the morning, it is my
determination and my wish and my prayer&mdash;and
he is worthy of it all!  I am beginning to feel it,
Mari&mdash;but will I ever be worthy of <i>him</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said her friend, "a brighter day
will dawn for us all; we must remind each other
of that when the clouds are hanging low."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," answered Gwladys.  "I am now going
to prepare the tea.  Thinking is my enemy, which
I must keep out of my life until I am an old
woman.  Perhaps, then, when I am sitting here
with my spectacles, and knitting, I shall be able
to think again."
</p>

<p>
"Fforwel, then," said Mari; "perhaps I will
not come to-morrow till afternoon."  And she
drew her shawl tightly around her and ran all
the way home, helped by the winter wind, which
blew icily from the sea.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys busied herself with her preparations
for her husband's evening meal, clattering the
tea-things, humming at her work, and making
believe to be a busy housewife absorbed in her
small duties; and her attempts at cheerfulness
were not without some measure of success.  But
it was a fictitious and unreal calm, and one which
she was conscious might at any moment crumble
into ruins.  But for the present her newly-formed
resolutions kept her up; and as she tossed the
frizzling lightcakes on the griddle, she tried to
hum an old familiar tune, which had of late been
a stranger to her lips.
</p>

<p>
It was at this moment that Hugh came in
from the gusty twilight; he heard the crooning
song, and the sadness deepened in his face, and a
light shot into his eyes from some hidden spark
of jealous suspicion.
</p>

<p>
"She's happy," he thought; "she has seen
Ivor!" for during the afternoon the latter had
been absent from his work for an hour or so, and
Hugh had noted it and had wondered.
</p>

<p>
He closed the door when he entered, fighting
rather testily with the blustering sea-wind, which
was accustomed to find easy access into every
part of the house.  Doors were always left open
at Mwntseison, except in the stormiest weather
or when a death had occurred, so Gwladys looked
up with astonishment.
</p>

<p>
"Gwen is coming down the road, and I
thought thou wouldst be better without her."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes&mdash;bolt it, bolt it!" she said, her
colour coming and going.  "I am afraid of her."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I think we shall all be afraid of her
soon," he said; and while his wife placed a chair
for him under the chimney, and drew the round
table near the fire, and piled his plate with the
crisp lightcakes, he explained to her his arrangements
for sending Gwen to the asylum.
</p>

<p>
"Poor thing, poor thing! but it will be best
indeed.  I will be glad when thou art with me
always, Hugh.  'Tis nervous work to be alone
all day, while she haunts the village like a grey
ghost."
</p>

<p>
"Hast had no company to-day, then?" said
Hugh, with a searching glance.  "Hast not been
out?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, as far as mother's; but I did not meet
Gwen."
</p>

<p>
Hugh was silent, and Gwladys' spirits flagged
a little.  She was conscious of some brooding
thought in his mind, and with her continued
feeling of guilt and self-upbraiding, she became
nervously silent too.
</p>

<p>
The next day, in the sail-shed, Hugh was
gloomy and pre-occupied, and Ivor Parry
observed it with sorrow.  He, too, was full of
troubled thoughts.  To lose Gwladys was a bitter
trial; but what a solace it would have been could
he have kept Hugh's friendship&mdash;this man whom
he had loved and almost worshipped.  But now
he realised the truth that, in the nature of things,
such a solace was impossible.  They must walk
along the road of life apart, and it were well that
the severance should be soon and complete.
Even to-morrow he hoped to leave the sail-shed,
with all its lingering associations of happiness
and sorrow; and, when five o'clock came, he
remained alone, making some final arrangements
which would facilitate the winding up of the
Mishteer's affairs.  He had not noticed that
Hugh had not left with his workmen as usual.
In truth, the latter was now sitting before his
desk in the little office, whose badly-fitting door
let in between its gaping boards a full view of
the shed.
</p>

<p>
The evening shades were fast darkening the
old room, and Ivor Parry had lighted a lamp,
whose glimmering beams showed up the rafters,
the coils of rope, and the other impedimenta
scattered about the floor.  Hugh, sitting at his desk
in the darkness, could see the whole scene
through the chinks in the half-open door, and he
gazed silently at Ivor's manly form now stooping
to re-arrange something on the floor, now
stretching to reach something from the rafters;
and his heart ached with a dull longing for the
time that was past, for the friendship which had
filled his life more than he knew at the time, and,
if the truth must be told, for the old days before
his passion for Gwladys had enslaved him.  Those
days could never return.  He had bowed his
neck to the yoke, and henceforth she must be
his first care and thought; and how easy and how
sweet this would have been, if only&mdash;and he
brooded there in the darkness with mournful
eyes and a heavy heart.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a step at the door of the
sail-shed, a finger raised the latch, the door was
pushed open, and Gwladys entered.  Hugh
trembled in every nerve, and watched eagerly
what would happen.
</p>

<p>
For a moment, her only thought seemed to
be to shut out the boisterous sea-wind, which
was swirling outside the door; then she threw
back the hood of her cloak, and looked in
astonishment, while Ivor Parry, no less taken by
surprise, lifted himself up from a bale of sail
upon which he had been kneeling.  Gwladys
involuntarily clutched her hand to her side, while
Ivor stood straight before her, with both arms
hanging down beside him.  Hugh's black eyes
never swerved in their keen glance; it never
struck him that he was acting dishonourably; his
suspicious anxiety seemed to have smothered
every other feeling, as he sat there peering at the
unconscious actors in the scene before him.  A
crimson flush spread over Gwladys' face and neck
and forehead; but Ivor was pale as death.
Neither spoke for some time.  Her breath came and
went in little fluttering gasps.  Ivor was the first
to regain his self-possession, and Hugh strained
every nerve to listen.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Mishtress, how art thou?"
</p>

<p>
"I only came," said Gwladys, ignoring his
question, "to fetch Hugh's coat, and to look for
him.  He has not come home."
</p>

<p>
"They have all left," said Ivor, glancing into
the darkness of the little office.  "I have only
stayed on a bit to make things more plain for
the Mishteer&mdash;I am going to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was all her answer, while her head
drooped, and she nervously and unconsciously
slipped her ring up and down her finger.  She
seemed suddenly anxious to get away, and,
turning hurriedly to the peg on which a coat of
Hugh's was hanging, said, "I want it to darn."
</p>

<p>
The peg was just above her reach, so she
sprang a little from the ground, and succeeded in
dislodging the coat from its hook, but in doing
so caught the wrist-band of her jacket in its place,
and hung, with toes just reaching the ground, in
a helpless and uncomfortable position, trying
with her left hand to loosen the wrist-band from
the hook&mdash;an object which the weight of her
body frustrated.  Ivor's first impulse was to rush
to her assistance, and every pulse in his body
throbbed with the desire once more to hold her
in his grasp; but his arms again dropped down,
and he turned resolutely to a coil of ropes, and,
dragging it within reach of her feet, said:
</p>

<p>
"Stand on this, Mishtress."
</p>

<p>
His white set face and his trembling voice
were the only signs of the storm that raged
within him; but they sufficed to make plain to
Gwladys, as well as to the silent watcher behind
the half-closed doors of the office, the strong
curb which he was placing upon his feelings.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys stepped off the coil of ropes, stood
a moment, trembling and blinded with her tears.
</p>

<p>
"That nasty hook has shaken thee," said Ivor;
and she made no answer, but, stooping to pick
up the coat, gulped down a sob which Ivor and
Hugh distinctly heard.
</p>

<p>
"Fforwel, then!" she said, turning back for
a moment as she reached the door.  "I wish
thee well at the mill, Ivor Parry."  And she
passed out into the night wind.
</p>

<p>
"Fforwel, Mishtress!" caught her ear as she went.
</p>

<p>
For a few minutes, Ivor stood with folded
arms, looking after her into the darkness, and
then sitting down on the bale upon which he had
been at work, a great sob shook his frame, too,
and it was with a veritable groan of distress that
he once more rose and applied himself energetically
to his work.
</p>

<p>
In the darkened office Hugh still sat on; but
his head was bowed upon his hands.  A feeling
of humility, never quite a stranger to his noble
heart, tinged the bitter thoughts which occupied
the silent half-hour which passed before Ivor
Parry extinguished his lamp and left the sail-shed,
locking the door behind him.  Then Hugh rose,
and letting himself out through a small door
from his office, walked homeward through
the blustering gale which swept up the village
road.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys looked up from her knitting as he
entered the house with relief, and, rising to meet
her husband, placed a trembling hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Hugh, where have you been? you are so
late!  I would be frightened, indeed, only I know
you have much to do to settle things before you
give up."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, business, merch i; I am not often late
for meals&mdash;too good an appetite for that, Gwladys;
and you cook them too nicely for that!  What
have you for supper?  Something good, I can
tell by the smell."  And he rattled on to hide
the embarrassment which he saw in Gwladys'
face.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, fried herrings and onions; you like
them, don't you?" she said, with a wistful
anxiety to please, very touching to Hugh in his
present mood of self-reproach; "and a white loaf
Madlen has made for thee."
</p>

<p>
"Supper then, and business to the winds!"
said Hugh cheerfully.  "Come and sit down,
merch i, or the board will not be full."
</p>

<p>
"I went to look for thee," said Gwladys,
sitting down opposite him at the small table, "but
there was no one in the sail-shed except Ivor
Parry."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps indeed!" answered Hugh, with
simulated indifference; "I suppose he had some
last arrangements to make; he is going to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he told me."  And with the relief of
having been perfectly open, Gwladys ate her
supper, and talked with more ease and cheerfulness
than she had shown at first.
</p>

<p>
Hugh hastened to change the subject, and
with tender thoughtfulness took more than his
share of the conversation all the evening.  If
there was one good trait stronger than another in
his character, it was justice.  Before all things,
Hugh Morgan had been a "just" man; and
there was growing in his heart, where at first
anger and suspicion had held their own, a strong
feeling of admiration for these two&mdash;his friend
and his wife&mdash;who had met under his own eyes,
where nothing but their honourable natures
restrained them, where they thought no eye was
upon them to mark a loving look, no ear to hear
a tender farewell, no tongue of scandal to blame
them, and yet had come forth immaculate,
spotless, blameless, from the trial.  He doubted
whether he himself would have passed scathless
through the temptation, and the nobility of his
soul responded to the perfect freedom from guile,
which he had seen in the interview between Ivor
and Gwladys.  It was not to be wondered at,
therefore, if, in the days following, his voice, his
manner, his actions towards his young wife bore
the stamp of a more than usually gentle and
chivalrous homage.  It fell on Gwladys' perturbed
spirit like a tonic, bracing her for still more
strenuous efforts to keep in the difficult path on
which she had entered.  And so outward calm
and peace brooded over the Mishteer's cottage,
for within it were two beings, who, though the
glamour and beauty of life were denied them, yet
walked courageously on with open brow and
steadfast feet, looking neither to the right nor
to the left, but simply to the endeavour to do their
part nobly in the battle of life.
</p>

<p>
To Mwntseison also had returned a season of
calm.  Its inhabitants had latterly been
considerably uplifted, not to say inflated, by the
evident personal notice accorded to them by
Providence!  Gwen's bidding, with the unheard-of
generosity of the donors, had been like a pleasant
fillip to the lethargic tendency of the rural
mind, had stimulated and whetted their appetites
for more sensations, so that the Mishtress's
narrow escape had been received with much appreciation.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes," said 'n'wncwl Jos; "there's many
things in Mwntseison which you won't find in
any other village along the bay.  Look at
Aberython and Clidwen; and there's Treswnd and
Abermere!  Is there a man like the Mishteer in
one of those places?"
</p>

<p>
"No!  Nor a woman like Mari Vone neither!"
said a burly sailor.
</p>

<p>
"No, no!" said 'n'wncwl Jos again; "there's
no doubt the Almighty keeps His eye on us, 'cos
look at Lallo's pig now!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it seems to me," said Shoni, the blacksmith,
who was always inclined to be irreverent,
"that He wasn't watching very closely when
Gwen did that nasty trick!"
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't He, then!" said 'n'wncwl Jos, stumping
violently with his wooden leg.  "What was
to prevent her killing her mother instead of
the pig?  If poor Gwen felt she must kill
something, what could be better than the pig?"
</p>

<p>
"What, indeed?" said everybody; "for
though he was hurried away rather (not so long,
too! for he was to be killed in a month), he is as
well salted and dried as any pig ever was, and
lying safe in sides and hams on the shelves in
Rhys Thomas's shop."
</p>

<p>
"Ach y fi!  I won't touch that bacon whatever,"
said Nell.
</p>

<p>
"And look at Ivor Parry, brought safe from
the sea and the fever.  Oh, yes, caton pawb! it's
as plain as the day.  Mwntseison is well looked
after!"
</p>

<p>
And there were many of the young and frivolous
who wished for a few more sensations, since
it was evident that they brought them no harm.
</p>

<p>
"When is Gwen going to the 'sayloom?" said
Shoni-go.[<a id="chap13fn1text"></a><a href="#chap13fn1">1</a>]  "She was screaming and laughing
like a mad thing, as she is, last night, and flying
like a partridge over the cliffs, her arms spread
out, and her toes just touching the ground.
Diwedd anwl! my heart nearly leapt out of my
body when I heard her!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said 'n'wncwl Jos, "the Mishteer will
see to it soon."
</p>

<p>
But a greater excitement than Gwen's madness
was hanging over the village, for in a day
or two the astounding news was spread abroad
that 'n'wncwl Jos was ill.  'N'wncwl Jos! who
had never been known to suffer an ache or a pain,
except, indeed, the rheumatic twinges which he
declared he still felt in the leg which was buried
in Glasgow!  'N'wncwl Jos, who, though not
wanting in sympathy, still tinged his
expressions thereof with a slight tone of blame, as
though sickness was invariably "somebody's"
fault.  And the strongest man in Mwntseison felt
his tenure of life uncertain.
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb! what's the matter with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Flammashwn!  Never been well since he
jumped into the sea after the Mishteer, when he
kept his wet clothes on all day, though he won't
confess it," said Dye Pentraeth; and the whole
village was in a state of ferment, and Mari Vone
was besieged by condoling friends.
</p>

<p>
The invalid at first fought valiantly with his
sickness, declaring he would be all right in a day
or two.  The doctor shook his head, and hour by
hour 'n'wncwl Jos grew worse, but still continued
to crack his jokes when a moment's cessation
from pain enabled him to do so.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, go 'long with you, Nell Jones," he said,
when that worthy woman came in with what she
considered an appropriate expression of countenance.
"Go 'long with you, Nell, and don't pull
a long face here; I've bin a deal worse than this!
Why! at Glasgow, when I lost my leg, I came to
myself when they were carrying me from the
docks to the hospital.  I didn't know where I
was in that straight, narrow thing&mdash;'a stretcher'
they call it in English&mdash;and raised my head to
see, and there I was being carried by four men,
and a long tail of boys, and men, and women
running after me.  'J√¢r-i,' sez I to myself, 'I
never thought I should see my own funeral!'  Well,
in three weeks, I was out of the hospital,
and&mdash;and&mdash;let me see&mdash;where's my wooden leg?
I want to go down to the shore; there's a boat
coming in&mdash;&mdash;" and he rambled away in delirium,
and in spite of his plucky spirit, his sickness
conquered him, and for many days he lay at the
point of death.
</p>

<p>
Then came the time when the warmth and
tenderness of the Welsh hearts were shown&mdash;not
a man, woman, or child who did not feel a
personal sorrow.  They took it in turns to watch
through the long nights at the sick man's bed,
with eager interest anticipating every want, and
endeavouring to make Mari Vone's burden
lighter.  From every farm in the neighbourhood
came presents of milk and eggs.  The sailors
brought high-shouldered bottles of Hollands and
Schnapps; the fishermen dared the storms to procure
fish; and even the children brought eggs or
apples for Mari.  Gwladys was a frequent visitor;
and Hugh often sat beside the sick man, whose
illness he felt was due to his faithful, though rash,
devotion to himself.  His presence seemed to
have a soothing effect upon 'n'wncwl Jos; the
excited, delirious talk would quiet down to a
low rambling, even to a pleasant recalling of
youthful days of merriment, and Mari Vone
learned once more to welcome the sound of
Hugh's footsteps as he approached the cottage
door.
</p>

<p>
One afternoon, while Hugh sat beside him,
the old man fell into a calm, refreshing sleep, a
sleep that had been anxiously watched for by
Dr. Hughes, but which seemed dangerously long
delayed.  Hugh knew the importance of this sleep,
and, nodding to Mari, said quietly, "Go and
rest thyself, I will watch till he wakes;" and
she had gone thankfully, and resting on her
own bed, the tension of the long anxiety was
relaxed, and the drooping eyelids were fast closed
in as heavy and refreshing a sleep as 'n'wncwl
Jos's.
</p>

<p>
Through the broad, gaping hinges of the
tar-painted bedroom door, standing half open, Hugh,
as he sat there motionless, holding the sick man's
hand, could see into the cosy penisha, and out
through the open doorway into the road.  It
was one of those calm, sunny days which
sometimes visit us in November.  The sound of the
sea filled the air, the click of Shoni-go's anvil,
and the voices of the children at play on the
beach, came on the breeze.  Hugh sat on quietly
dreaming, letting his thoughts roam uncurbed
over the events of his past life.  He remembered
how, in the days gone by, he had crossed the
threshold of this cottage with the ecstatic
buoyancy of a lover, not unmixed with the reverence
of a worshipper who enters the shrine which
contains his idol.  Certainly he had loved Mari Vone
with a depth and intensity which he thought
neither time nor eternity had power to annihilate.
"Neither has it," he thought, "it is only
altered.  I am a married man now, and Gwladys
has my love, my respect, my tender pity; but
there is a bond which links me to Mari Vone, so
pure, so strong, so enduring, that I fear not to lay
it before God, and to ask His blessing upon it."
</p>

<p>
At this moment a shadow darkened the outer
doorway, and a light footstep (everyone walked
gingerly there now) came into the kitchen.  Hugh
raised his eyes, and a pleased, indulgent look
came over his face as he saw through the crack
that it was Gwladys.  "The little one, bless her!"
he thought, but he made no movement; and
Gwladys, noticing the restful quiet in the house,
the cessation of the rambling voice in the
sick-room, guessed at once that the hoped-for sleep
had come, and prepared to leave on tip-toe.  She
stood a moment at the table, laying down a
bowl of curds and milk which she had brought
for Mari, and at that instant another figure
darkened the doorway, and raising her finger to her
lips to enforce silence, she saw Ivor Parry enter
silently.  Hugh saw it all, too, and found it
difficult to keep his hand quietly on 'n'wncwl Jos's.
For a moment, as before, the two who confronted
each other in the kitchen stood embarrassed and
silent; but Gwladys first regained her composure,
and in a whisper, which Hugh's quick ear caught
distinctly, said:
</p>

<p>
"'N'wncwl Jos is asleep, I think."
</p>

<p>
"I am glad," said Ivor; "that is good news.
I could not let another day pass without coming
to ask for him.  I am going back at once."
</p>

<p>
"You had better stay," said Gwladys, "till
Mari comes out.  I am going."
</p>

<p>
Ivor nodded silently, and Gwladys passed out
into the sunshine.  Left alone, he drew his hand
over his face as if awaking from a dream, and
Hugh watched him gravely.  Suddenly a light
gleamed in his eyes, a flush overspread his face,
and looking round like a thief who espies a
treasure, he stretched out his hand to the table, and
clutched a bunch of sea-pinks which had fallen
from the folds of Gwladys' neckerchief.  Hugh
had noticed them there when she entered.  For a
moment Ivor looked at them, then pressed them
to his lips before thrusting them inside the breast
of his coat.  He stood a few moments in silent
thought, and then left the house.
</p>

<p>
In the inner room, Hugh still watched with
troubled eyes; but the hand which held the sick
man's remained firm and unmoved, and 'n'wncwl
Jos slept on.

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
THE MILL.
</h3>

<p>
Round the old mill at Traeth Berwen the
night wind sighed and moaned, as it always did
here at the opening of the narrow valley.  Even
in the hot summer days, when the cattle sought
the shade, and the flowers drooped languidly,
there was always a breeze blowing up or down
the cwm, and to-night it blew in gusts round
every gable of the old building, shaking the
ricketty shutters, and brushing the overhanging ivy
against the window panes.  Inside, however,
there was no sign of anything but comfort and
cheerfulness.  On the stone hearth in the large
kitchen a bright fire glowed, on which a huge log
had just been thrown, a crowd of crackling
sparks and blue smoke flew up the wide open
chimney, and the ruddy glow brought into relief
the numerous pegs and stakes driven into its
brown smoked walls, for the suspension of future
flitches and hams when Ivor Parry should have
become more settled into his domestic menage.
At present it was empty, and as Ivor and his
friend Robert the miller sat well under its shade,
they could look straight up its wattled walls
to the night sky above, where a bright star shone
down upon them.  On a small table beside them
stood a quaint brown jug of ale, accompanied by
two "blues"; they smoked in silence, while
Acsa clattered her pails and wooden shoes in the
background.  She had lived there all her life, at
least from childhood, as maid-of-all-work to
Robert and his family, and had been taken over
by Ivor Parry as part of the furniture.  Indeed,
to have separated Acsa from the mill would have
been a difficult task.  Robert had attempted it
once, when some of her wilful ways had tried the
good-wife beyond endurance; but she had howled
and cried like a beaten dog, and had stayed
starving and cold about the precincts of the mill so
pertinaciously, that she was at last allowed to
re-enter, to the delight of the children, and to the
secret satisfaction of the miller and his wife, who
had missed her faithful service.  No one had ever
tried to eject her again, so here she was to-night,
perfectly satisfied to click clack about in her
wooden shoes, in and out of the brown shadows,
scraping the potatoes, cleaning the shoes,
scouring the brass pans and the pails, without a
thought of any reward, except the small pittance
of wages which she always received with humble
gratitude and a bob curtesy on the 11th of
November, this being the day appointed all through
Cardiganshire for the ending and beginning of a
year of domestic service.
</p>

<p>
Robert had come down for a smoke and a
chat with his successor at the mill, and they had
apparently exhausted every topic of interest, for
they puffed long in silence.  Suddenly a weird
wailing sound came down the chimney, and both
men looked up at the shining star above them,
while Acsa exclaimed, "Ach y fi!"
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" said Ivor, listening with his
pipe in his hand; and again on the night wind
came the long-drawn mournful tones of a
woman's voice, who sang some old-world melody
with a wild refrain.
</p>

<p>
"Mark my word, 'tis that Gwen Owen
again!" said Robert, "that mad woman from
Mwntseison; she has taken to coming here lately,
and sits on the edge of the cliffs, always at
night, and always singing the same tune.  I am
beginning to know it quite well; indeed, I think
I must have heard my mother sing it, and I
believe she called it a Witch Song."
</p>

<p>
"I seem to know it, too," said Ivor.  "Let us
go out and listen."
</p>

<p>
"Howyr b√¢ch," said Acsa, "there's foolish
you are to tempt the Almighty like that! when
He has given you a warm kitchen to sit in, you
go wilfully out to listen to a witch tune!  Take
care she doesn't draw you away with it; she is
Peggi Sh√¢n's grand-daughter, and you know,
Robert the Mill, that your own uncle Simon was
drawn by her singing out there on her father's
smack, till he was lost in the fog and drowned!
Ach y fi! don't venture."
</p>

<p>
"Twt, twt," said Robert, "she's far enough
from us here."  And he slipped back the wooden
bolt and opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Shut it after you, then!" screamed Acsa,
"for I won't let the tune in here; but, oh! there
it is in the chimney again!"  And she set herself
to her scrubbing to deaden the weird sounds.
</p>

<p>
Outside Robert and Ivor listened, while full
and clear on the night-wind came Gwen's voice,
sometimes in a low, soft, wailing tone, almost
lost on the breeze; sometimes rising as if in tones
of entreaty; at other times in passionate words
that almost ended in a shriek.
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb!" said Ivor, "she is madder
than I thought she was!"  And, as a large white
owl flitted silently by them, the two men started
nervously.
</p>

<p>
"It's enough to make one's blood run cold.
There! do you hear the crows?  She has startled
them from their nests on the cliffs."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Gwen!" said Ivor.  "I never thought
she would come to this.  Let us go near her and
hear what she says."
</p>

<p>
And up the side of the bank they went on
the soft turf, until, on reaching the top, they
saw Gwen standing on the very edge of the cliff,
with arms outspread, and gesticulating wildly,
singing, and sometimes talking.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Oh, winds and waves and flames,<br />
  I call you by your names,<br />
  North, South, East, West,<br />
  Hither come, do my behest,<br />
  And hasten now to help me!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
They were close to her, but hidden by one of
the many boulders scattered about the greensward.
</p>

<p>
"How she repeats that verse," said Ivor.  "I
am afraid of her, Robert&mdash;not for myself, but for
some of them at Mwntseison.  She means to do
some mischief with her waves and her winds and
her flames.  Listen! she is talking."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, night-wind, I hear you, I know
what you are saying&mdash;'Be ready, Gwen&mdash;be
ready, Gwen! and we will help you.'  Hush!"
and, with her finger raised, she bent over the cliff
until the strong men shuddered with fear.
"Hush! 'tis the sea; I hear you whispering 'Be
ready, Gwen&mdash;be ready, Gwen!' but you are
worthless! bant a chi[<a id="chap14fn1text"></a><a href="#chap14fn1">1</a>]&mdash;bant a chi!  I have a
better friend than you, though he is not here
to-night," and turning round she caught sight of a
shower of sparks which rose from the mill
chimney.  "Yes, he is&mdash;yes, he is!" she screamed,
clapping her hands and dancing with delight;
"there are his signs!" and she burst into the
wild refrain of her weird song once more:&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Come flames of yellow, red, and blue,<br />
  Help! for you are my servants true."<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Good-night," she said, waving her hands
towards the old mill, "I understand your message;
I will be there, and you will be there."  And,
turning, she fled back towards Mwntseison, as
Shoni-go had said, "like a partridge," with arms
spread out, her grey shawl held like wings, and
her toes scarce touching the ground.
</p>

<p>
Ivor and Robert came slowly out of the shadow
of the rock.
</p>

<p>
"J√¢r-i!" said the latter, "I thought the
witches were dead; but, God save us, we have
heard one sing to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Poor Gwen," said Ivor, remembering many
a kindness which she had shown him before she
had married Siencyn Owen, "she's no witch, only
a poor misguided woman, whose life has turned
sour, like milk in a thunderstorm.  Remember
she was brought up by that uncanny old sinner
Peggi Sh√¢n, and now it pleases her to think she
has the same 'hysbys' nature."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps she has," said Robert, "for such
things are."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps indeed," said Ivor.  "Anyway, she
can do mischief, and I must keep an eye on
Mistress Gwen."
</p>

<p>
And they returned to the mill, where Acsa
let them in with a sense of relief.
</p>

<p>
"Another glass of beer before you start?"
said Ivor.
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, indeed, and another whiff; that
tune has given me a shiver.  Ach y fi!" said
Robert, taking up his long clay pipe once more.
"I am glad to see thee so comfortable, Ivor.
'Tis a wife thou wilt want most here now.  Come
up to Blaensethin, lad, and see my three pretty
daughters; perhaps one will suit thy fancy."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps indeed," said Ivor.  "I have heard
they are so pretty 'tis wiser to keep away; but
I am safe, for a wife is a piece of furniture that
the old mill will have to do without as long as I
live.  I am born to be an old bachelor."
</p>

<p>
"Twt, twt," said Robert, rising, "come up to
see us on Monday, and we will go to Elinor
Pugh's bidding together, and let's see if we can't
knock the old bachelor out of thee."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I won't promise; but we shall see,"
said Ivor.  "Nos da!"
</p>

<p>
"Nos da!" shouted Robert, taking the opposite
direction to that along which Gwen had
flown homewards.
</p>

<p>
Ivor pondered long, lying awake in his bed
and listening to the sighing of the wind and the
swish, swish of the waves on the beach below the
mill.  No other sound broke the silence of the
night except the "to-whit, to-hoo" of the white
owl who sat in the ivied tower of the old church
higher up the valley.
</p>

<p>
All next day he was too busy for much
thought, for, with the early dawn, the carts came
down the hills from one of the farms on the
uplands.  He heard the merry crack of the whip
and the lively whistle of the carters, while he
donned his mealy garments, and, looking through
his ivy-curtained window, he saw the brilliant
scarlet and blue carts come lumbering down the
hill, making a bright bit of colouring in the
leaden winter landscape.
</p>

<p>
He hurried down to open the big door, and to
pull up the dam-board from the leet, turning the
water full on the cumbrous wooden wheel, for he
would not have it said that "the new miller was
caught napping," and before eight o'clock the
mill was filled with the sound of the grinding and
crushing of the big millstones, the clap, clap of
the wheel, and the musical rushing of the
Berwen as it poured and trickled through the rude
machinery.
</p>

<p>
The empty carts returned up the hill, to come
again in the evening, when the new corn and
oats had been ground into the sweet brown flour
and delicious oatmeal, in readiness for the barley
loaves and oat-cakes of the farm.
</p>

<p>
One of the men servants and two jolly lasses
stayed in the mill, and shouted their jokes and
chaff at each other through the noise.
</p>

<p>
Ivor, on his mettle, worked with a will, grinding
the corn, and endeavouring to show that the
old Melin Berwen had still a thorough and a
jolly miller at the head of affairs.  He joined in
the merry laughter and talk, which helped on the
work of the day; but through it all the memory
of Gwen's wild song haunted him, and, mingled
with the whirring and rushing of the mill, he
seemed to hear the tones of the refrain:
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Come, flames of yellow, red, and blue,<br />
  Help; for you are my servants true!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
When at last the meal had been tied into the
sacks and the brilliant blue and red cort√©ge
returned up the hill with whistling and shouting
and laughter, Ivor climbed up the ricketty stairs,
and changed his mealy clothes for his usual
half-sailor garb.  As soon as his tea was over he
turned his face in the grey of the evening towards
Mwntseison.  It was almost dark when he
reached the village, and he was puzzled where to
begin his search for Gwen.  "In her own home?
No! that would set her on her guard!  Where
he most dreaded to find her&mdash;in Gwladys' home?
No! there he must not enter!"
</p>

<p>
Mari Vone's white-walled cottage was the first
to appear through the twilight.
</p>

<p>
"Of course!" he said, "I want to know how
'n'wncwl Jos is."
</p>

<p>
He listened at the open door for a minute to
the sound of voices within.  No!  Gwladys' clear
tones were not there; but 'n'wncwl Jos's
"Hegh! hegh! hegh!" was distinctly to be heard.
</p>

<p>
"Hello!" he said, in a cheery voice as he
entered, "no need to ask how the sick man is!"
</p>

<p>
Mari placed a chair for him by her uncle's
side, who was bubbling over with tales and
laughter, his wooden leg once more in its proper
place, and the usual quid of tobacco in his
cheek.
</p>

<p>
"Hooray, mach-geni! there's glad I am to
see thee!  Wel wyr! they have been nearly killing
me here with their pills and their draughts
and things; but old 'n'wncwl Jos has diddled
them all this time!"  And with a poke in Ivor's
ribs, he laughed and stumped with something
like his old jollity.
</p>

<p>
"Don't listen to him, Ivor b√¢ch!" said Mari;
"thee know'st him of old.  There never was a man
more ready to take his physic, so anxious he was
to get well; not a pill nor a draught would he
miss, and all day he watched that clock to keep
me up to time with his doses!"
</p>

<p>
"Listen not to her, lad," said 'n'wncwl Jos,
rather shamefaced; "she's a woman, and they
always know how 'to change the feather to the
colour of the river.'  And how dost get on at
Melyn Berwen?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well so far!"
</p>

<p>
"Don't thee take too much toll now," said the
old man, with another nudge.  "Mari's got two
Winchesters of barley for thee to grind next
week."
</p>

<p>
"Da iawn![<a id="chap14fn2text"></a><a href="#chap14fn2">2</a>] and how does Mwntseison get
on without me?  How is Gwen?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, indeed, better, I think," said Mari,
throwing a fresh log on the fire; "she does not
wander about the village so much&mdash;goes over
the cliffs and speaks to no one.  Hugh Morgan
thinks it is a pity to put her into an asylum just
yet, while she is so quiet."
</p>

<p>
"Clap her in! clap her in!" said 'n'wncwl
Jos; "she'll be safe there, that's my advice."
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed, it seems cruel to say so; but I
think so, too," Ivor answered; and he proceeded
to tell them of her eccentric behaviour on the
cliffs the previous night, and the uncanny nature
of her song.
</p>

<p>
Mari Vone laughed heartily; looking up from
her knitting, she said:
</p>

<p>
"Why, Ivor b√¢ch, hast forgotten thy childhood
completely?  Dost not remember that old
game?  Why, we played it in a ring on the sands
in the summer evenings, singing those words all
the time.  Every child in Mwntseison knows it!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, b'tshwr!" said Ivor; "what a ffwlcyn[<a id="chap14fn3text"></a><a href="#chap14fn3">3</a>]
I was!  Well, indeed, I thought it seemed
familiar to me somehow; and Robert Owen,
too, said he thought he had heard it somewhere."
</p>

<p>
'N'wncwl Jos was extremely amused.
</p>

<p>
"Well, there's two fools you were!  'There's
a pair of you,' as the devil said to his wooden
shoes."
</p>

<p>
Ivor joined in the laugh, and felt relieved by
the discovery of his mistake, more particularly
when Gwen herself entered the house suddenly
and silently.  She stood a moment, with her
white face and piercing eyes half hidden under
the shade of her grey shawl.  A silence fell upon
them as they encountered her cold stare, and Ivor
was the first to speak.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Gwen f√¢ch!" he said kindly; "and
how art thou and Lallo?"
</p>

<p>
"I am quite well, Ivor Parry, and my mother
is quite well.  How art getting on at the
mill?"  And without waiting for an answer, she went
quietly away.
</p>

<p>
"We can't call that woman mad enough for
an asylum, poor thing!" said Mari.
</p>

<p>
"I say, clap her in!" said 'n'wncwl Jos;
"she'll be safe there.  Clap her in!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, she seemed quiet enough to-night,
and sensible.  Perhaps I have been too easily
frightened," said Ivor.  "Wilt promise me, Mari,
to send over to the mill if she shows any signs
of mischief?"
</p>

<p>
"I promise."
</p>

<p>
"Then good-night," said Ivor; "I was a fool
not to know the old game song."
</p>

<p>
As he passed Gwen's cottage, Lallo stood at
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I am glad," she said, "that thou hast
not quite left us, Ivor Parry.  Come in, come in,
and have a chat, for I am all alone."
</p>

<p>
"Where is Gwen, then&mdash;and how is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, she's better&mdash;very quiet indeed, and
gone to bed."
</p>

<p>
"Da iawn!" said Ivor, "that is good news."  And
making the lateness of the hour an excuse
for not entering, he returned over the cliffs to
Traeth Berwen.
</p>

<p>
Acsa was still up when he entered the mill
kitchen, stooping over the fire and crooning an
old Welsh hymn.  With an oar-shaped porridge
spoon, she stirred the "bwdran" which babbled
in the iron pot hanging from a chain in the
chimney.  In her quaint Welsh costume, a red cotton
handkerchief tied under her chin, her hard-featured
face catching the light of the glowing fire,
she looked like a witch who stirs the broth in
her cauldron.
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb, woman," said Ivor, as he entered
and bolted the door, "why art not in bed?
I wish I had one of those new machines for
taking pictures&mdash;I believe I would make my fortune
by selling a few of thee, sitting there over
thy bwdran in the peat smoke."
</p>

<p>
Acsa laughed, and disclosed a toothless upper
gum.
</p>

<p>
"Do then, indeed," she said&mdash;"'twould be the
first time old Acsa had been of use to anyone."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, halt there," said Ivor, sitting down to
his supper.  "I don't know how I should get
on here without thee.  Give me a bowl of bwdran."
</p>

<p>
"Well," she said good-naturedly, as she laid
the steaming bowl before him, "I am a good
watch-dog; I can watch my master's property
as well as any policeman, and as for the
foxes&mdash;they find me much too sharp for them.  Never
a fowl can they get from Berwen Mill."  And
she mumbled on while Ivor hurried through his
supper, and, leaving her still clattering amongst
her pans and dishes, went to bed, and quickly to
sleep.
</p>

<p>
He had not slept more than an hour or so,
when Acsa, as if to maintain her character of
"watch-dog," thumped at his bedroom door.
</p>

<p>
"Mishteer, there's a strange light in the
sky&mdash;a fire in Mwntseison, I think."
</p>

<p>
"A fire in Mwntseison!"  And almost before
she had spoken the words, Ivor was up,
and hurrying on his clothes.  "A fire in
Mwntseison!  Had he not dreaded it, pictured
it?&mdash;was he not even dreaming of it when Acsa gave
the alarm?"
</p>

<p>
While he dressed he looked out at the sky,
and over the brow of the hill before him; the
glow reddened and spread.  He was quickly
crossing the yard and climbing up the rugged
path to the cliffs; and having reached the top,
he ran with breathless speed towards the village,
every moment nearing the crimson glow, now
mixed with sparks, which illumined the sky
before him.
</p>

<p>
A few hours earlier, just as Ivor was entering
Mwntseison and hesitating as to where he should
begin his search for Gwen, Hugh Morgan and
his wife sat down to their comfortable tea
together, while Madlen hovered about, or drank
her tea on a bench under the chimney, helping
herself from her own special tea-pot, which sat
snugly in the embers on the hearth.
</p>

<p>
"There's quiet the village is, now that Gwen
Owen is better," she said.  "Indeed it is heaven
upon earth not to hear her screaming and laughing.
Lallo will be glad she didn't send her to
the 'sayloom."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, poor thing," said Hugh; "I am very
thankful I have been saved that horrid job.
'Twould have gone hard with me to take one of
our village lasses to that big grey building at Caer
Madoc.  It always gives me a shudder when I
pass it, though I never had a relation there; hadst
thou, Gwladys?"
</p>

<p>
"No, indeed, as far as I know, whatever; but
I can't bear to see it, too, so many of our friends
are there, poor things.  Poor Laissabeth Davies,
whose two sons were drowned together."
</p>

<p>
"And Sianco, the lobster man," said Hugh.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and Nell who used to paddle with me;
poor Nell."
</p>

<p>
"Ach y fi! yes," said Madlen from her
chimney corner; "and there's two or three more
from Mwntseison would be locked up there if
their friends were not so quiet about them."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps they would be better off in the
'sayloom," said Gwladys.  "Indeed, I thought
so to-day when I passed poor Reuben Pentraeth's
window at the back of his mother's house all
boarded up.  It must be so dark inside, with only
those chinks to let in the light.  I often hear him
singing when I pass."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he doesn't lose his fine voice," said
Hugh, rising; "it makes my heart ache to hear
him.  But I must go, merch i; I daresay I will
be late coming home to-night, for I have my last
accounts to make up.  Everything will be
finished to-night, and to-morrow Josh Howels and
I will sign our names to the contract; and then
good-bye to the old sail-shed for ever.  Don't sit
up for me, merch i.  Leave the door on the
latch."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, anwl!  I'm afraid of Gwen, Hugh."
</p>

<p>
"No, go to bed, Mishtress," said Madlen.
"I will be up with the brewing till four o'clock,
and I will let the Mishteer in."
</p>

<p>
And with a pleasant nod Hugh Morgan left
the house.  It requires nothing less than a death,
or a parting for years, to make a Welsh husband
kiss his wife before stranger eyes.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys, when she had finished her own part
of the brewing, went to bed and to sleep, while
Hugh sat over his accounts in the sail-shed
until his candle burnt low and the last column
was added up.  Then, with a satisfied "There!"
he pushed the book away from him, and leaning
back in his chair, fell into a heavy sleep, quite
unconscious that a grey, ghost-like figure
hovered round and round the old sail-shed,
sometimes pressing her ear to the keyhole, sometimes
peering in through the tiny window of the office;
making no sound on the soft turf that crept up
close to the boarded walls of the shed, for she
carried her wooden shoes in her hand while she
watched the busy man bending over his accounts,
and at last, in healthy fatigue, throwing himself
back for a refreshing sleep.  Yes! so heavily
Hugh Morgan slept, that he did not hear the
creeping footsteps outside, nor yet the crackling
of burning wood around him, nor smelt the sickening
fumes from burning sails and ropes, which
served to deaden his oppressed senses.
</p>

<p>
When Ivor Parry, "with his breath in his
throat," reached the burning building, he found
the whole population of Mwntseison gathered
round it, everyone eager to help, but all
paralysed by the horror of the scene.  Where was the
Mishteer? he who would have been foremost in
helping and directing the surging crowd; his
absence took the nerve and pluck out of everybody,
and the fear that he might be in the shed
intensified the excitement.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys, overcome by terror, lay swooning in
her mother's arms.  She opened her eyes when
Ivor's voice reached her ears.
</p>

<p>
"Save him, Ivor, thy friend! save him if thou
lov'st me!"
</p>

<p>
Her mother, who overheard her words, looked
round in affright, lest any other ear should have
caught the frenzied accents.
</p>

<p>
Ivor was gone in a moment.  Leaving the
crowd, he passed round to the back of the shed
where the little office was situated, and which the
flames had not yet reached.  One woman was
already there.  It was Mari Vone, who, in frantic
excitement, dragged at the boards which formed
the walls of the building.  Her whole being
seemed centred in the effort to break a way into
the office.  Ivor wasted no time in words, but
joined her at once in her mad tearing at the
boards, and with his additional strength, one at
length gave way, and in a few seconds a hole
large enough to pass through rewarded their
efforts.  A column of smoke rushed with such
fury through the opening that, for a moment,
both were thrown back.  But, not to be beaten,
Ivor pressed in through the blinding smoke,
followed closely by Mari.  They heard the shouts
and cheers of a small portion of the crowd, who
had now assembled on that side of the building
and watched their efforts; but there was no time
for thought, for fear, or for conjecture; only one
mad impulse, to search on the ground while their
breath lasted.  Not at the desk! not at the
cupboard!  Even at that moment of strained
suspense the memory of a tune passed through Ivor's
brain.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Come, flames of yellow, red, and blue,<br />
  Help! for you are my servants true!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Stumbling at the door, he stooped, Mari with
him, and felt the Mishteer's body lying prone
across the threshold.  A heavy beam lay over
his chest; his feet and legs were already licked
by the curling flames; while his head and shoulders
lay within the little office.  Ivor saw or felt
the situation at once, and Mari, whose busy
fingers groped with his in the smoke, understood
it, too.  With almost superhuman strength, he
lifted the heavy beam, while Mari dragged Hugh
gently, but firmly, away from its crushing weight.
</p>

<p>
The density of the smoke was not quite so
great on the floor as it was higher up, and to
this fact Hugh Morgan hitherto owed his life.
He was quickly carried to the breach in the wall,
which willing hands had enlarged during the
few seconds occupied in his deliverance, and,
when Ivor and Mari emerged with their silent
burden, a shout of joy rose from the people&mdash;a
shout which quickly subsided into an awestruck
silence when the straightened form lay
motionless on the grass before them.  Not a moment
too soon had they made their escape, for the
office was now in a blaze of swirling flames.
</p>

<p>
Quickly the news of Hugh's safety was conveyed
to Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"He's alive, Mishtress!  Ivor and Mari have
brought him out!"
</p>

<p>
But she did not hear them.  At the words,
"He's alive," the reaction from the terrible fear
that had paralysed her was so great that she
fainted, and in this condition was carried home.
</p>

<p>
A stretcher had been quickly improvised from
an old sail, and Hugh, gently laid upon it, was
also carried home by loving hands, and laid
tenderly upon his own bed, Mari Vone refusing to
allow anyone but Ivor and herself to lift him
from the sail to the bed.  He moaned once or
twice during the removal, and afterwards lay
still and motionless, with closed eyes.
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hughes, who, together with all the
inhabitants of Abersethin, had seen the fire at
Mwntseison, was quickly on the spot, and
attending to Hugh Morgan, while Gwladys, white and
rigid, tottered in like a ghost and flung herself
down at the bedside in an abandonment of grief.
The sound of her sobs reached Hugh's ears, and,
opening his eyes, he tried to speak, but failed in
the attempt.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," said Dr. Hughes; "lie quite still
until you are stronger.  Now take this&mdash;and you,
Gwladys, be quite silent if you wish to save your
husband's life."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys smothered her sobs, and, sitting still
and shivering beside her husband, said, in piteous
accents:
</p>

<p>
"Don't send me from him! let me stay and
do something."
</p>

<p>
"You can do nothing but be calm and quiet."
</p>

<p>
"I will," she said; and she kept her word.
</p>

<p>
In the early dawn of the next morning, pale
and worn with the night's watching, she looked
out through the low thatched window on the
leaden waters of the bay, stretched out before
her in the cold grey stillness of the late autumn
morning.  There was a pale yellow light in the
eastern sky, but down on the waters of the bay
the dark curtains of night had scarce yet been
drawn.  She shuddered as she looked at the
broad expanse of even silence, unruffled by a
wave, untouched by the morning's sun.  "What
would the day bring forth?" and she turned
again to watch the quiet form upon the bed.
</p>

<p>
He had been restless with pain in the early
part of the night, but for the last hour he had
lain silent and still, the dark eyelashes resting
upon his pale cheek, the masses of black hair
lying damp and matted on the sunburnt forehead,
his breathing scarcely audible.  "Was it
sleep? was it unconsciousness? was it death
already creeping over him?"  The anguish of the
thought was too great for her over-strained
nerves, and she shrank on her knees by the
bedside, and, burying her face in the bedclothes,
sobbed convulsively:
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not that! not that!  Oh, God, not that!"
</p>

<p>
She would have given worlds for time to
repair the wrong she thought she had done&mdash;to
bring peace and happiness to the heart to which
she had caused so much sorrow.  "Was it too
late?  Would God listen to her prayer, and spare
him yet a while?  Oh, God! give me one more
chance," was her continual cry.
</p>

<p>
But the wheels of life rolled on, unchecked by
their course, the still form moved not, scarcely
breathed, and the morning hours passed wearily
on.  Her mother brought her a cup of tea; Mari
Vone came gently into the room, gazed a moment
at the sleeper, and passed out again, leaving
Gwladys to her watch alone.  It was her place,
and, without comment, everyone acceded to her
earnest request, "Let me be with him! let me
watch him!" only they hovered near within call,
while Gwladys still watched on.

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
TORN SAILS.
</h3>

<p>
In the village the excitement was intense, for
where the sail-shed had once stood&mdash;the backbone
of Mwntseison, the dispenser of the means of
livelihood to so many families&mdash;there was now
nothing but a smouldering heap of charred wood,
surrounded by a ring of horror-stricken villagers.
'N'wncwl Jos had suggested a dreadful idea last
night when Hugh Morgan was carried home and
laid on his bed.
</p>

<p>
"Wasn't I right?" he said, as he stumped
back to the burning building; "didn't I say
'clap her in'? and if they had done so, we should
not have lost the best man that ever trod the
sands of Mwntseison!"
</p>

<p>
"What! dost mean Gwen? anwl! anwl! mad
as she was she wouldn't have injured the Mishteer!"
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed," said Dye Pentraeth, "I was
coming home late last night from Traeth Berwen,
and my heart nearly jumped out of my body
when I passed the sail-shed, for who should I
see standing close to the wall but Gwen; she was
the same colour as the grey boards.  Ach y fi!
I was frightened."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes," said 'n'wncwl Jos, "'tis plain
enough who did it&mdash;and where is she now?  Nobody
knows! and there is poor Lallo, druan
f√¢ch! seeking her everywhere!"  And beginning to
f√¢ch! seeking her everywhere!"  And beginning to
relish the part of "seer," he added, "And nobody
will see Gwen again; she has run away, probably
to Caer Madoc.  Wel, 'twill save us the trouble
of taking her there, for I'm sure I don't know
how we're going to manage that now, nor anything
else whatever, without the Mishteer.  Oh,
bobol anwl!  I have lost a friend!"
</p>

<p>
"But Dr. Hughes is very clever, perhaps he
will bring him through," said one of the crowd;
"if not, what will become of us all, and the
Mishtress, druan f√¢ch!"
</p>

<p>
Little groups of people, with anxious and
mournful faces, were gathered together here and
there along the rocky road.  To lose the
Mishteer from their midst! the thought was
unbearable!  He had for so long been their guide and
support&mdash;his strong will and good moral
influence had been for years the moving spring of
their lives, unconsciously to themselves and to
him&mdash;and his death, therefore, would be a dire
calamity.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, frindiau," said Josh Howels, "if
we ever expect any good to come of our prayer
meetings this is the time to hold one."  And a
murmur of approval followed his words.
</p>

<p>
"When shall it be, then?" said 'n'wncwl Jos.
</p>

<p>
"Wel! there's no time like the present," said
Josh Howels; and with one accord they turned
en masse to the door of the Methodist chapel, and
filled the square building to overflowing.
</p>

<p>
In their strong poetic language they poured
forth their supplications; and if sometimes the
prayers uttered in their meetings had been
aimless, creed-bound perorations, to-day all was
reality and earnestness, though tinged by the
nautical imagery ever uppermost in their
minds.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis our Mishteer we are coming to Thee
about, O Lord," said Josh Howels, in a voice
made tremulous by suppressed feeling; "but
Thou knowest that.  Forgive our weak words,
for we are shaken in our hearts, and blinded with
our tears.  Spare us the Mishteer, we beseech
Thee, for without him how can we steer our frail
barks across the troubled sea of life?  When the
storms arise, and we are tossed about in the
waves, who will point us to Thee?  Spare him,
O Lord, for the aged pilgrims still to lean
upon! so that the middle-aged may not lose his
companionship, and that the children may still have
his example to steer by!"
</p>

<p>
Tears and sobs filled up the pauses in the
prayer.
</p>

<p>
"But if," he added, and here there was a
breathless silence, "if it be not Thy will to spare
him to us, if he must go, then, Lord, pilot him
safely into the harbour! guide his frail bark over
the dark and stormy waters! make a rift in the
clouds, O God! and give him a glimpse of the
Morning Star!"
</p>

<p>
One after another they knelt and poured out
their souls in prayer, with the strong craving
for relief from the tension of fear and sorrow
which was weighing them down, and it was
three o'clock in the afternoon before the meeting
broke up.  Of course they could not separate
without singing a hymn.  And that hymn was
long remembered at Mwntseison; its rising and
falling cadences had never so torn their
heartstrings&mdash;never hymn before had been so mingled
with sobs and tears; and when it came to an end,
they left the chapel in solemn silence.
</p>

<p>
In a short time they were once more gathered
round the scene of the fire, and anxiously
inquiring for news of the Mishteer's condition.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly there was a cry of horror from the
children, for where the flames had risen highest,
and the fire had burnt the fiercest, they pointed
to a little heap of charred bones, which lay in
the midst of the debris.  They would scarcely
have been recognisable as human remains but for
the iron buckles of Gwen's wooden shoes which
lay beside them.
</p>

<p>
"Dear God!" said the scared villagers,
"who'd have thought of such a thing!  'N'wncwl
Jos was right after all!  Oh, vila'nes!
vila'nes!"[<a id="chap15fn1text"></a><a href="#chap15fn1">1</a>]  And not even the gruesome sight before them
could quite restrain their expressions of horrified
anger.  But a silence fell upon them when Lallo
appeared in their midst.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, is it true what I hear?" she cried; "that
my Gwen is burnt? that she did this dreadful
deed?  Gwae fi[<a id="chap15fn2text"></a><a href="#chap15fn2">2</a>] that I had taken the Mishteer's
advice before it was too late!  Oh, merch anwl
i! my beloved daughter!" and turning with
imploring hands to the crowd of bystanders, she
pleaded for their forgiveness.  "Don't be too
angry with her.  Remember my beloved child
was not wise; ever since she lost her baby she
wasn't wise.  Oh, my Gwen! don't judge her too
harshly!"
</p>

<p>
Even the strong men were touched by her
sorrow, and gently led her away, while all that
remained of poor Gwen was reverently gathered
together.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, in the quiet room under the
thatch, Gwladys still watched, and Mari Vone
crept silently in and out, carrying down scraps
of information to Ivor and 'n'wncwl Jos, who sat
in the deserted kitchen, hoping for some news of
improvement.
</p>

<p>
Ivor's arm was tied in a sling, for it had been
badly injured in his frantic efforts to lift the
heavy beam under which he had found Hugh.
The flesh had been lacerated almost from wrist
to elbow, yet he had felt nothing until Hugh had
been carried home, and there was no more for
him to do.  The flames had caught his hands, too,
and he was suffering much, in spite of Dr. Hughes'
soothing dressing; but he heeded nothing&mdash;scarcely
felt his pain, so intense was his
anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Mari escaped without a burn.  The same
extraordinary Providence that had carried her
through life unscathed and unmarred by the
ravages of time seemed to have preserved her
unhurt through the terrible experiences of the
preceding night.
</p>

<p>
Ivor was struck afresh by the ethereal beauty
of her appearance.  She seemed lifted above the
sorrow which he knew was pressing so heavily
upon her.  In the stress of her agony the night
before he had overheard the words: "Oh, Hugh
fanwylyd!" and Ivor, so accustomed to the
continual haunting void in his own heart, required
no word of explanation.  He knew it all, and
realised with a sudden intuition the long years
of crushed hopes and unselfish devotion of this
woman.
</p>

<p>
At length there was a little movement on the
boards above their heads, and Mari once more
crept half-way up the stairs and listened,
returning with a smile on her lips.
</p>

<p>
"He is better!  I hear them talking quietly.
Let us go and leave them together."  And they
went out, gently drawing the door on the latch.
</p>

<p>
Ivor went home with them, for "Dear God!"
he said, "I cannot go to the mill till he is better;
and, besides, I will be nearer Dr. Hughes, and
for thy kind nursing."
</p>

<p>
"B'tshwr, Ivor b√¢ch.  'Twill save me the
walk over the cliffs, for I will not lose sight of
thee until thy arm is well.  Thou hast risked thy
life for the Mishteer.  Come and stretch thyself
on 'n'wncwl Jos's bed."  And Ivor, worn out
with his exertions, did as he was bid, and lay
quiet for some hours, suffering much in mind
and body.
</p>

<p>
In the sick-room, while Gwladys watched,
Hugh Morgan had opened his eyes naturally and
calmly, as one who awakes refreshed from a long
sleep.  Her heart leapt for joy, but she was
learning to curb her feelings.
</p>

<p>
"Art better, Hugh b√¢ch?" she said gently.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, merch i," was the quiet answer, after
which he relapsed again into silence, while with
observant eyes he looked around him, seeming
to ponder thoughtfully the condition of things,
taking in and arranging in his mind all he saw,
and all that the scene suggested to him.  This
at least was Gwladys' impression, and she wisely
waited a few moments before speaking again.
</p>

<p>
"This has been poor Gwen's work.  Isn't it
so, Gwladys?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Hugh b√¢ch."
</p>

<p>
"Poor soul! poor soul!  Thou hast gone
through a bad time, merch i.  Thou hast been
called to bear much sorrow in thy young days."
</p>

<p>
Gwladys was crying silently.
</p>

<p>
"But thou art better now, Hugh, and the
light is shining again!  Oh! it will only be an
ugly dream that passes away with the morning,
now that thou art better.  I cannot help crying;
but it is for joy, Hugh b√¢ch, thou hast slept so
long!  I feared thou wouldst never awake, and
now the joy is too great for me."
</p>

<p>
He smiled.  "Poor little thing! druan f√¢ch!"
and again the long silence and the deep
pondering.
</p>

<p>
"Now I will fetch a cup of tea, Hugh; it will
refresh thee."  And she called down the stairs
with such joy and cheer in her voice, though in
hushed tones, that Madlen knew at once what
had happened, and in five minutes the news had
spread through the village, "The Mishteer was
better!&mdash;was talking!&mdash;was going to have a cup
of tea!"
</p>

<p>
But Hugh declined the proffered cup, and
thus dashed Gwladys' hopes to the ground.  To
refuse a cup of tea after a long night's sickness
seemed to her to point to something very serious.
</p>

<p>
"No; let me be till the doctor comes," he
said.  "I feel pretty easy lying here; but something
tells me not to move.  Sit by me, f'anwylyd,
and let me ask thee a few questions.  Who was
it saved me from that deadly furnace?  I awoke
choking, and tried to stagger into the shed; but
at the door of the office a heavy beam fell on
me.  Who lifted it and carried me out?  Ivor
Parry, I am sure! faithful friend and true!  But
I thought there were two?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Hugh, it was Mari Vone."
</p>

<p>
"God bless her, and thou, Gwladys!  Where
wert thou?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hugh, those terrible flames seemed to
scorch my life away.  I was in a faint in my
mother's arms.  Thou know'st of old I am a
coward!"
</p>

<p>
"Poor little one, no wonder!"  After another
pause, he asked, "Is there anything left of the
sail-shed?"
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, Hugh b√¢ch! but don't thee speak
another word, until the doctor comes."
</p>

<p>
And so he once more lay silent and motionless,
until Dr. Hughes' step was heard on the
stair.  Gwladys hastened to meet him with a
smile of gladness.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, doctor, he is much better!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, go down, Gwladys, while I look at
him."  And she went, wondering at the doctor's
serious looks.
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Dr. Hughes, after an examination
of his patient, "I am glad to find you
so easy, so free from pain; but we are old
friends, Hugh Morgan, and I will not deceive
you.  You have been seriously&mdash;h'm, h'm&mdash;caton
pawb!  Why do women always pull the
blinds down!"  And he rose and fumbled
awkwardly at the blinds to hide the moisture which
gathered in his eyes.  "You are a brave man,
Hugh Morgan, and I think I ought to tell
you&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Don't trouble to tell me anything, doctor.
There is something broken <i>here</i>, which not all
your skill can mend," and he laid his strong
brown hand upon the region of his heart.
</p>

<p>
"Not there, my dear fellow&mdash;on this side and
lower down."
</p>

<p>
"Perhaps indeed! it doesn't matter what&mdash;if
it must end my life; only tell me how long I
shall live&mdash;minutes&mdash;or hours&mdash;or days?"
</p>

<p>
Dr. Hughes took the hand which still lay
upon his heart, as if the pain were there, and
clasping it in both his own said gently:
</p>

<p>
"A few hours!  It grieves me to the heart to
say this, Hugh Morgan, but I will not deceive
you.  I advise you not to move.  Lie perfectly
still and you may escape all pain."
</p>

<p>
Hugh's breast heaved with the panting breath,
but he showed no other signs of distress.
</p>

<p>
"When I am gone, will you send for Mr. Lloyd
the lawyer from Caer Madoc? he knows
all my affairs.  There will be less than I thought
for Gwladys, owing to the fire; but still, thank
God! there will be enough to keep her
comfortably.  I am sleepy."
</p>

<p>
"I will go, then," said Dr. Hughes, "and will
come again."  And he went softly down the
stairs, to find Gwladys impatiently awaiting him.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, doctor, he will live, won't he? he is
better, isn't he?"
</p>

<p>
"You must be brave, Gwladys," he answered
gravely.  "There is a terrible sorrow in store for
you, and it depends upon how you bear it whether
you make your husband's last moments peaceful
or unhappy.  May God strengthen you, merch i!
Where is Mari Vone? she will be a comfort to
you."  And leaving Gwladys standing in stony
despair, he drove to Mari's cottage, and in a few
words told her of Hugh's impending death.
</p>

<p>
She did not speak a word, but, turning a
shade paler, she prepared at once to leave the
house to comfort Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
Ivor still lay in the heavy sleep which had
fallen upon him, and Dr. Hughes refused to
awaken him.
</p>

<p>
"No, let him sleep while he can, and I will
see him later on."
</p>

<p>
Then Mari took her way down the village
road.  All the sorrow and pain she had ever
suffered seemed now to have reached their climax.
She entered the comfortable kitchen, where
Madlen sat crying on the settle.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Mari f√¢ch! what will we do? how can
we live in this cold world without the Mishteer?"
</p>

<p>
Mari's lips were white with suppressed sorrow.
She could not answer, but passed quietly
up the stairs.
</p>

<p>
In the sick-room Hugh still slept on, and
Gwladys, white and rigid, sat beside him.  There
was a silent embrace between the two women,
but no sound broke the stillness except the heavy
breathing of the motionless figure before them,
and so the long hours passed on.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon Dr. Hughes once more came
in, but only stood looking sorrowfully down at
the sleeper.
</p>

<p>
As the evening shadows drew on, for the November
sun was near its setting, and the little
room grew darker, Hugh began to move
restlessly, while Gwladys and Mari watched
anxiously.  Suddenly he opened his eyes, and, in the
first moment of awakening, made an attempt to
change his position slightly; but a look of
anguish overspread his face, and a sharp cry
escaped his lips, as he fell back once more into
motionless silence.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he called, "Ivor!  Ivor Parry!" and
quickly Ivor, who was now waiting below with
Madlen, heard his own name, and hastened to
the bedside.
</p>

<p>
Evidently Hugh Morgan's life was fast ebbing away.
</p>

<p>
Ivor was so overcome by the sight of his
dying friend that for a few moments he could
only stand speechless at the foot of the bed, until
he heard again the broken voice which called
him by name.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys had flung herself down by the side
of the bed, and with her face buried in the
bedclothes, tried to control the heavy sobs which
shook her frame.
</p>

<p>
"Here I am, Hugh b√¢ch!" said Ivor, bending
over Hugh's prostrate form.
</p>

<p>
"Art there, lad?  Give me thine hand.  Wilt
forgive me, Ivor, for all the pain I have caused
thee?  'Twas done in ignorance; say thou wilt
forgive me, lad.  Let us part friends, as we have
always lived."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Hugh!  I have nothing&mdash;nothing to
forgive thee; only to be deeply grateful to thee.
Thou hast filled my life with kindnesses, and
above all, with thy friendship.  I have not been
worthy of it, but I have never wilfully done
anything to betray it."
</p>

<p>
"No," said Hugh; "we can meet on the
other side with open brows&mdash;friends for ever,
Ivor!  Gwladys&mdash;thine hand!  Lift my head a
little without moving my body."  And Mari,
seeing that Gwladys was too overcome to move,
passed her arm gently under his head.
</p>

<p>
"That will do.  Now I must make haste,"
and placing Gwladys' hand in Ivor's, he looked
at him with serious but calm eyes.  "Ivor, I
leave her to thee; take care of her for my sake;
thou know'st now my wishes.  Fforwel, Ivor!
I feel my life is going.  Fforwel, Gwladys, my
beloved child!"
</p>

<p>
There was a long silence, only broken by the
panting breath and Gwladys' sobs.
</p>

<p>
Ivor had gently laid her hand on the coverlet,
and retired once more to the foot of the bed.
</p>

<p>
"Who is holding my head?"
</p>

<p>
"'Tis me, Hugh&mdash;Mari Vone.  Hast one
word of fforwel for me?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he said; "lean forward that I may see
thy face, lass."  Already his words came broken
and disjointed.  "Death is always a revealer, and
I see everything plainly now.  Mari, no fforwel
to thee."
</p>

<p>
Another long silence, while the face bleached
visibly, and the dark eyelashes drooped on the
waxen cheek.  The lips moved, and stooping
over him, Mari caught the words:
</p>

<p>
"Torn sails, broken mast!" and something
about "in port at last!"
</p>

<p>
Breathlessly they waited for the end, when
suddenly the eyes opened wide, and in clear
though low tones, Hugh Morgan's voice was
heard once more.
</p>

<p>
"Mari," he said.
</p>

<p>
"I am here; close to thee, Hugh anwl."
</p>

<p>
"Come soon," and with these words his spirit
took its flight.
</p>

<p>
In a few days all that was mortal of Hugh
Morgan was laid to rest in the little churchyard
on the hill.  Gwladys had completely succumbed
to her sorrow, and she lay unconscious in the
delirium of fever, while her husband's funeral left
the house, thus escaping all the heart-searching
accessories of a Welsh burial&mdash;the muffled tread
of the crowd who assemble, the peculiar mournful
monotone of the prayers, and above all, the
wailing, sorrowful tones of the funeral hymn.
In her absence, Ivor and Mari followed as chief
mourners, and never in the memory of Mwntseison
had there been so large a gathering.
</p>

<p>
All that remained of poor Gwen was buried
in the same little churchyard on the brow of the
hill, where the sea winds swept over her grave
and Hugh's alike.  The seagulls flew over them
both, and the harebells nodded over them, and
no stranger passing by would have guessed the
tragedy that connected the two graves.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys lay long under the grasp of the fierce
fever; but a healthy constitution and the vigour
of youth at last conquered, and she came slowly
back to consciousness and health.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, life in Mwntseison had returned
outwardly to its usual routine, though the death
of the Mishteer caused a blank in the lives of
his work-people which Time was slow to fill up.
But there is no one who, leaving his place vacant,
is irretrievably missed; another is ready to step
into his place, and the wheels of life go on with
unchangeable uniformity.
</p>

<p>
Joshua Howels rebuilt the sail-shed, and once
more the inhabitants of the village found their
subsistence from their daily avocations there.
</p>

<p>
The loss occasioned by the fire fell upon
Gwladys; but, in spite of this, Mr. Lloyd, the
lawyer, was able to announce to her the possession
of a small, but sufficient, competence for one
in her position in life.
</p>

<p>
"His kindness reaches me still," she said.
"Oh, mother, I wish I had been more worthy
of it."
</p>

<p>
"Everyone knows thou hast been a good
wife," said Nani, but without looking at her
daughter.
</p>

<p>
She had an intuitive suspicion that the river
of Gwladys and Hugh's married life had not
flowed on unruffled; but she was a wise woman,
and buried the knowledge, with many other
secrets, in her tender heart.
</p>

<p>
Gwladys had come home to live with her once
more, and Joshua Howels had married, and gone
to live in the Mishteer's old house.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
PEACE.
</h3>

<p>
Weeks and months slipped by, and when two
years had passed away, the events connected with
Hugh Morgan's death had been almost forgotten;
only in some hearts their memory lived on, fresh
and green, undimmed by the lapse of time.
</p>

<p>
At Melin Berwen, Ivor Parry's life appeared
to glide on in peaceful monotony.  He was an
industrious and honest miller, and business flowed
in apace, so that his days were fully occupied,
and it was only at night, when the mill wheel
was silent, and he sat alone under the big chimney,
smoking or reading, that his musings led him
into sad memories of the past&mdash;of the close
companionship and warm friendship, which had been
broken so suddenly for him and the Mishteer.
</p>

<p>
In the queer old mill kitchen, the evenings
were always cosy; and Ivor Parry, like most of
the peasantry, gathered much pleasure and
satisfaction from the hours spent on his lonely
hearth.  There was always the country gossip
gathered by Acsa from every stray caller at the
mill, and retailed at night for his benefit, while
she clattered about her work.  Although they
belonged to the same class, there was a fine
discrimination in her nature, generally possessed by
the Welsh peasant, which forbade her sitting
down at the hearth with her master, unless
requested, and even ordered to do so; and then the
order would be obeyed in an awkward, shame-faced
manner, and at the first opportunity she
would break away with some excuse of a
forgotten duty.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the evening, Ivor would open
the old glass bookcase which stood in the corner.
It had been found there by Robert Owen when
he entered the mill thirty years before, and left
by him as impedimenta when Ivor took his place
there.  It was filled not only with account books
and musty papers, but also contained the old
books accumulated by two or three generations
past: dog-eared, brown-leaved books of travel, of
history, of biography, all of old-world interest,
but which Ivor pored over with the thirst for
knowledge which is so strong an element in
Welsh life; and if the knowledge he gained
was but crude and imperfect, still the pleasure
he derived from his hour's reading was great.
</p>

<p>
The only modern intelligence that reached the
old mill came in the weekly newspaper and the
yearly almanac, the latter being studied in Welsh
cottages with great interest.
</p>

<p>
"Are you hearing what I am saying, master?" Acsa
would ask sometimes, when her rambling
story had brought no response from Ivor;
and he would close his book with a bang, and
return to his everyday interests, and often to his
sober musings and memories of the old sail-shed,
and of his careless, happy life before his ill-fated
visit to Aberython.  He rejoiced to think that at
last Hugh knew him as he was!  And then came
the memory of that last scene, when Hugh had
placed Gwladys' hand in his, and the fierce strong
desire of his life rose unquenched within him,
that "some day," when time had softened her
sorrow, she would remember her husband's
dying wishes.  He scarcely ever went to
Mwntseison&mdash;it recalled too vividly to his mind the
painful scenes of Hugh's death; and when he did
go, it was no further than to Mari Vone's
cottage.  To her he felt irresistibly drawn, and
though never a word passed between them on the
subject of his love for Gwladys, or of hers for
Hugh, yet both felt that between them existed
the link of a mutual understanding.
</p>

<p>
When the winter was over, and the earth was
beginning to swell and burst with the throbbing
of new life within her, even into the dusty mill
the spring breezes carried suggestions of green
things, Ivor began to walk in his sunny garden,
which stretched along the side of the hill even to
the edge of the cliffs.  Here Acsa, in short
petticoats and wooden shoes, was already beginning
to dig the leek-bed, and in the corner, under the
furze hedge, a clump of sweet violets sent up a
fragrant greeting.  Ivor paused and looked at
them; he remembered seeing a posy of them
once in Gwladys' bodice.  Why should he not
take her these?  He had never seen her alone
since Hugh's death, had never happened to meet
her on the cliff or in the village, and even on
Sundays he did not see her, for she and her
mother had taken to the new chapel which had
lately been built on the other side of the Gwendraeth.
</p>

<p>
He gathered the violets slowly, adding green
leaves, and tying them with a blade of long
grass.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, spring is coming, and this is a sunny
garden," observed Acsa.  "We shall have a fine
bed of leeks here.  Caton pawb! what are you
going to do with those?"
</p>

<p>
"I think, perhaps, Mari Vone would like them."
</p>

<p>
"Shouldn't wonder, indeed," said Acsa.
"She's an odd woman; there's pretty she is!
They say God's blessing is upon her that she
never grows old; and she's thirty-seven in
May&mdash;that I know, because Mary, my sister's
daughter, is the same age.  She looks old
enough to be Mari Vone's mother; 'tis very
strange."
</p>

<p>
Ivor pondered, as he went slowly over the
cliffs, upon Mari Vone's unfading beauty.  Latterly
she had seemed to him fairer than ever, and
even to grow younger as the days passed on.
There was a light in her eyes, a happy smile on
her lips, and her coils of golden hair looked more
than ever like an angel's crown.
</p>

<p>
"She is beautiful, no doubt," he thought,
"with a beauty that reminds one more of heaven
than earth.  Mari's troubles have been changed
to golden blessings, I think."
</p>

<p>
She was busily laying the simple supper on
the table when Ivor entered, 'n'wncwl Jos telling
her one of his marvellous tales, punctuated with
stumps of his wooden leg.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Ivor! come in; just in time for
supper&mdash;cawl it is, too, my boy."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Ivor!" said Mari, coming to meet him,
"there's sweet flowers.  I always say it is such
a shame there is no name for them&mdash;such a
sweet smell!&mdash;but never mind, I love them well
without a name."
</p>

<p>
"In English they call them violets," said
Ivor.
</p>

<p>
"Vayolet, vayolet!&mdash;oh, it suits them well.
I must share them with Gwladys."  And placing
them in a little mug of water, she made room for
Ivor at the table.
</p>

<p>
"How's all going on at Mwntseison?" he
said at last.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, just as usual," said Mari, with a smile.
"Poor Lallo seems to be coming back to her
cheery ways a little, though she looks much
older; and Gwladys, too, is getting quite well
and strong&mdash;she is busy in the garden every day
now, and often she comes down to me.  We like
to sit together, Ivor, though we don't talk about
the past&mdash;some things, thou know'st, are too
sacred for words.  But we understand each other,
and love to sit silent, with our knitting and our
thoughts."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," was all his answer; but she knew he
was grateful for her reference to Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"Wel wyr," said 'n'wncwl Jos, as she bolted
the door after his departure, "thee and Ivor are
such friends, perhaps thee'lt make a match of it
after all."
</p>

<p>
Mari sat down to laugh.  "Oh, 'n'wncwl
Jos!" she said, "will you never remember my
age?  I am ten years older than Ivor."
</p>

<p>
"So thou art, so thou art, merch i; but upon
my dear little deed, nobody would guess it."
</p>

<p>
As the spring advanced, and the days lengthened,
Mari frequently walked out over the cliffs
to gather bracken for Peggi Pentraeth's donkey,
sometimes going as far as the brow of the hill,
from which she could look down at the old mill
in the valley.  At these times, Ivor, seeing her
from below, would run up the sheep path to meet
her, just for a word of news from Mwntseison&mdash;just
in the hopes of hearing something of
Gwladys.  And Mari, who knew well what drew
him towards her, and what lent wings to the
vigorous steps with which he climbed the hill,
would always reward him with some scrap of
information.
</p>

<p>
"Price Merthyr preached at Tan-y-groes
Chapel last night, Ivor," she said one evening,
as they walked slowly over the cliff together.
"Gwladys and I went to hear him.  Her mother
questioned us close when we came home about
the sermon; indeed, we remembered pretty well,
both of us.  There was the pwnc[<a id="chap16fn1text"></a><a href="#chap16fn1">1</a>] after the
sermon, and we stopped for that" (Ivor listened
eagerly), "but not for the singing class, for, of
course, Gwladys cannot join in that yet."
</p>

<p>
"B'd siwr!" said Ivor, with a shake of his
head, for he knew, and felt himself, that to join
in the singing would look like disrespect to the
Mishteer's memory; "as far as that goes, 'twas
a long time before I could sing myself.  The first
tones of my voice brought the memory of Hugh
Morgan to my mind, and the singing seemed to
die away."
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell how it is," said Mari, "but I
can sing.  My heart seems strangely happy.  It
seems such a thin veil between us and Hugh, and
life is so short! so very short at the utmost, it is
not worth while mourning for anyone.  But I
must go.  See those fishing boats going in?  I
must see if they have any fish for 'n'wncwl Jos's
supper.  Fforwel, Ivor!" and she waved her
hand at parting.
</p>

<p>
He looked after her as her tall, graceful figure
was lost to view behind the broom bushes.
</p>

<p>
"J√¢r-i! she is a beautiful creature!" he
thought.  "How such a woman came to be born
at Mwntseison I can't think!"  And he trudged
down the hill, whistling as he went, his thumbs
in his armholes.
</p>

<p>
At the mill door stood a small boy who had
come up over the sands from Mwntseison, the
tide being low at the time.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" said Ivor.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis Eynon Bryneithin is wanting to know,
can he send his corn to be ground to-morrow?
He was coming up to see you himself, but he
got a hurt on his foot coming over the rocks,
and there he is now sitting at 'The Ship,' and
there he will be sitting till Catrine turns him out
to-night.  She sent me up to tell you."
</p>

<p>
"I will come back with thee and speak to
him," said Ivor, "for I cannot grind his corn till
Monday.  There's Glasynys coming to-morrow,
and Peutre-du next day," and Ivor took his way
once more to the top of the cliff, accompanied by
the boy.
</p>

<p>
The sun was setting in crimson and gold
behind the sea; the silver crescent moon rising
above the upland fields; the sea-gulls were flying
homewards overhead; and the little sea-crows
quarrelled and cawed as they settled down to
their nests on the sides of the cliff.  The sea
shimmered and rippled in the gorgeous colours
of the sunset, and the soft evening air was laden
with the scent of the furze, which spread its
golden mantle over every grassy knoll.  Even
the boy was struck by the beauty of the scene.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a nice night," he said.
</p>

<p>
"Br√¢f!" said Ivor, drawing in a long breath
of the perfumed air.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" said the boy, pointing to
something on the side of the path, a few yards in
front of them.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a woman," said Ivor, "resting; tired,
I suppose, poor thing!"  But as he approached
nearer his eyes took a troubled, anxious look.
"Can it be Mari Vone? 'tis like her red petticoat."
</p>

<p>
The boy ran on.
</p>

<p>
"Yis, 'tis Mari Vone, asleep, I think."
</p>

<p>
And Ivor hastened up to see a sight which in
all the coming years he never forgot.
</p>

<p>
Yes; 'twas Mari Vone who lay there, half
reclining against the grassy hedge, her cheek
resting upon her hand, her pillow a clump of
harebells and wild thyme.  Evidently she had
thrown herself down to rest, and rest was
depicted upon every feature of her face, and every
curve of her figure; the white eyelids were closed,
the waxen cheek was scarcely paler than usual,
and on the lips was a smile of ineffable sweetness.
</p>

<p>
"There's nice she looks!" said the boy, in an
awed whisper, "like an angel!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Ivor, chafing her hands, "like an
angel as she is.  Go, run to the village and bring
somebody here, and a sail to carry her."
</p>

<p>
For there was no doubt about it, Mari Vone
was dead.  The heart had ceased to beat, and
though she was still warm, and the fingers which
Ivor rubbed and pressed were pliant as his own,
he never doubted the fact; he knew that that
gentle spirit had quitted the beautiful tenement in
which it had lived for thirty-seven years; he knew
that he should never more see it look out of
those deep blue eyes, never hear it speak with
that tongue now silent, and a flood of sorrow
filled his heart.  He sat beside her while the sun
sank below the horizon; the grassy pillow upon
which she lay shone with the burnished gold of
its last rays, which threw also with its last kiss
a rosy flush over Mari's face.  Ivor gazed at her
with something of the awe which the boy had felt.
</p>

<p>
"Was it possible that this was death?"
</p>

<p>
The sea sighed and whispered on the shore below,
the evening breeze lifted the little stray curls
of her golden hair.  A thrush in a thorn-bush
near sang its last song to the sinking sun; the
flowers seemed to send up a stronger perfume
as they bent and trembled in the sea-breeze; the
clouds of gold and copper speckled the pale blue
sky; everything in earth, sea, and sky seemed to
speak of beauty and love, and in the next silent
half-hour Ivor realised more vividly the nearness
of things unseen than in his work-a-day life he
had ever done before.
</p>

<p>
When help came at last, he felt almost a pang
of regret at being robbed of that lovely form, in
whose presence he had experienced such a vision
of peace and beauty.  With hushed voices and
silent tread the villagers approached, and with
awe struck faces gazed at the silent form on the
green sward.
</p>

<p>
"There's beautiful&mdash;she's smiling!" said one.
</p>

<p>
"She has reason to smile, I expect," said
Joshua Howels, preparing to tenderly lift her, and
place her in the improvised stretcher brought
from the sail-shed.  "'Tis the same sail that
carried Hugh Morgan," he said; and solemnly and
slowly they carried their light burden to her
home.
</p>

<p>
"There's pity! poor 'n'wncwl Jos and Gwladys
Morgan are gone to Caer Madoc!" whispered
one.
</p>

<p>
"Wel, indeed, there's sad news for them,
whatever!"
</p>

<p>
"I hope she will alter before the funeral," said
a sturdy sailor, who had helped to carry her in.
"We won't like to bury her looking like that!"  And
the villagers crowded round to look at the
familiar face, whose strange unearthly beauty
struck even the children as something unusual.
</p>

<p>
Lallo and Nani Price attended to the arrangements
of the death chamber, allowing themselves
to be persuaded by Ivor to leave on the body of
his friend the clothes in which she died, instead
of arraying her in the grandeur of a Sunday
gown and the best clothes which she possessed.
They were rather scandalised, and gave way only
upon Ivor's pointing out to them how speckless
and fresh they looked&mdash;how snowy the kerchief
crossed on her bosom!&mdash;how beautiful the crown
of golden hair!&mdash;how pretty the dainty, shiny
shoes!  "You could never make her look better!"
</p>

<p>
"That's true, indeed, whatever," said Nani
Price; "and, after all, Mari Vone was different
to anybody else."
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb! yes," said Lallo; "never a
speck nor a smot upon her!  But <i>I</i> would be
sorry to be buried in anything but the clothes I
go to meeting in, or a decent shroud."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Nani, closing the door softly, as
they all left the room together, "Mwntseison will
be no better than any other village, now that
Mari Vone and Hugh Morgan have left it!  Ivor
Parry, wilt go and meet 'n'wncwl Jos and
Gwladys and break the news to them?"
</p>

<p>
"No," he said.  "Go you, Nani f√¢ch; it will
come better from a tender woman than a hard
man like me.  I will go to Dr. Hughes.  There
must be a 'quest, I suppose."
</p>

<p>
In less than a week Mari Vone was laid to
rest in the little wind-swept churchyard on the
hill; and none of the villagers seemed surprised
when Gwladys expressed a wish that her grave
should be dug close beside the Mishteer's.  Their
hearts had been too deeply moved for gossip,
and they seemed to have been impressed with the
reality of something beyond and behind the
fleeting scenes of life.
</p>

<p>
Later on, a simple white cross stood between
their graves with the words:
</p>

<p>
"In memory of Hugh Morgan (The Mishteer),
who died November 18th, 18&mdash;, aged 45.
And of his friend, Mari Vaughan, who died May
1st, 18&mdash;, aged 37.
</p>

<p>
"They were lovely and pleasant in their lives,
and in their death they were not divided."

CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
THE MILL IN THE MOONLIGHT.
</h3>

<p class="poem">
  "Little I know of life<br />
  By worldly joys begot,<br />
  But the rapture well I know<br />
  That dwells in a mountain cot;<br />
  The glory that comes at eve,<br />
  As I sit 'neath the elder tree,<br />

  Sink down behind the sea."<br />

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Another year had passed over the simple
village, whose history we have hitherto followed,
unmarked by anything more than the ordinary
events of daily life.  A golden harvest had been
gathered on the uplands, and the herring fishing
had been unprecedentedly plentiful.  The work at
the sail-shed was once more in full swing, and
Mwntseison was peaceful and contented.
</p>

<p>
Over the cottage fires in the evening, when
the peat burnt brightly, and the "uwd" simmered
in the iron crock, the events connected
with the Mishteer's and Mari Vone's deaths were
frequently the subjects of conversation; but
Gwladys' connection with them seemed gradually
forgotten.  She was amongst them still, and had
dropped so naturally into her old place of Nani
Price's daughter that her marriage was seldom
called to mind.  She was well content that it
should be so, for into the even flow of her
innocent life it had only brought a sorrowful
"troubling of the waters," from the memory of which
she shrank with a self-upbraiding regret, and she
never by word or deed alluded to the past.
</p>

<p>
Her simple, guileless nature was already
throwing off the clouds that had darkened her
life; a tide of youthful vigour and joy ran full
in her veins; Nature asserted her right to be
happy, and she seemed to grow in beauty as the
days sped on.  True, a pensive look often crossed
her face, but it rather added to, than detracted
from, the charm of her expression.  She gradually
took up all her old habits&mdash;tossing the hay
in the hay-fields; binding the sheaves in the
corn-fields; singing at her work in the garden; and
still carrying her creel to the beds of laver, to
the great relief of Nance Owen, who grew more
infirm with advancing years.
</p>

<p>
"There's good she is to me, calon f√¢ch!"[<a id="chap17fn1text"></a><a href="#chap17fn1">1</a>]
she would say.  "As isel[<a id="chap17fn2text"></a><a href="#chap17fn2">2</a>] as ever!  You would
never guess she had money in the bank."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, "the money in the bank" was little
more than a myth to Gwladys.  Mr. Lloyd, the
lawyer, looked after her affairs with great interest,
and the respect which every Welshman feels for
those who will not touch their capital.  He sent
Gwladys her dividends regularly; but the blue
envelope which brought them was always an
anxious mystery to the simple girl, and its receipt
was invariably followed by a journey to Caer
Madoc in Peggi Pentraeth's donkey-cart, where,
having deposited the money in the bank, she and
her mother returned with lightened hearts,
feeling very rich with a few sovereigns in their
pockets.  'N'wncwl Jos generally drove them on
these occasions, managing to receive his
"pinshwn" on the same day.  The journey was
always kept a dead secret beforehand, for "who
knew but that a donkey-cart bearing two such
wealthy people as Gwladys and 'n'wncwl Jos
might not be waylaid, and its occupants robbed
on the road."
</p>

<p>
Not that any inhabitant of the village would
do such a thing! but stray sailors from far-off
ports <i>did</i> sometimes find their way to Mwntseison,
and English tramps often passed through
in their wanderings.
</p>

<p>
'N'wncwl Jos had found a comfortable resting-place
for his latter years, for Lallo had come
forward with kindly offers of hospitality.
</p>

<p>
"Come and live with me and Siencyn," she
had said, when on his return from Mari's funeral,
the old man had begun to look mournfully
around him.  "Thou wilt be company for
Siencyn when he comes home, and when he is away
thou canst help me with that andras of a pig, for
he wants a firm hand over him."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, he'll get that," said 'n'wncwl Jos, "if I
come to live with you; and a firm leg, too, if he
doesn't behave."
</p>

<p>
And so it was settled, and Lallo found something
to occupy her time and thoughts; and the
old man, though he lost much of his jocularity,
regained by degrees his old cheerfulness, and
spent much of his time with Nani Price and
Gwladys.  He was always a welcome guest, not
only because of his connection with Mari, but
that sometimes he rowed up to Traeth Berwen,
and stumped up as far as the old mill to see Ivor
Parry.
</p>

<p>
"J√¢r-i!  Ivor is getting on," he said one
evening, while Gwladys, at her work, listened with
fluttering heart.  "He's getting a reg'lar jolly
miller; and there's beautiful cwrw Acsa
brews! without my secret, too.  But his heart is at
Mwntseison still, though so many friends are
gone from here.  There's questions he asks me.
'How is Josh Howels?' he sez.  'And how is
Nani Price and her daughter?'
</p>

<p>
"'Oh, quite well,' sez I; 'and Gwladys is as
ugly as ever.'"
</p>

<p>
Gwladys smiled pensively.
</p>

<p>
"'How is it you never come up to see us at
Mwntseison?' sez I; and he didn't answer, but
looked up after the smoke to the chimney."
</p>

<p>
A few evenings after this conversation
Gwladys took her way over the cliffs which
stretched at the back of the sail-shed towards the
valley of the Berwen.  She was bent on the same
kindly errand that had frequently taken Mari
Vone on this path, namely, to gather ferns for
Peggi Pentraeth's donkey.  She never went more
than half-way to Traeth Berwen, partly shrinking
from passing the grassy mound on which her
friend had breathed her last, alone and
unattended, and, moreover, a little proud reserve
withheld her footsteps.
</p>

<p>
If she went further than half-way, Berwen mill
would be in sight, and perhaps she might be seen
from the mill.  Not for worlds will a
well-brought-up Welsh girl give her lover a shadow
of reason to think that she is seeking him.  She
is not slow to respond to advances on his part,
but will never make any of her own.  So she
turned down a cleft in the cliffs, and gathered her
baich[<a id="chap17fn3text"></a><a href="#chap17fn3">3</a>] of green and golden bracken, and, tying
it into shape with a strong cord, sat down upon
it for a moment to watch the setting sun before
she slung it on her back.
</p>

<p>
Behind her the rounded hills rose brown and
flushed in the sunset light; around her the rushes
whispered in the evening breeze, the green
sward glowed in the sun's last rays, and every
nodding flower caught its crimson light.  The
sea murmured on the rocks below, the floating
sea-gulls still rose and fell on the heaving waters,
and though it was late autumn, a calm, serene
beauty brooded over land and sea, as though
summer had returned with a last lingering
good-bye.  Gwladys sat and watched the fading tints,
filled with tender memories of the past, not
unmixed with an awakening flood of hope in the
future; not untinged, too, with a feeling of
resentment against Ivor, who had been very chary
of his visits to Mwntseison of late.  She had
been thankful to him at first for his avoidance
of her; it spared her so much embarrassment.
But latterly, the longing to see him again had
grown upon her, and the old haunting hunger
for his love was again rising within her&mdash;not
that it had ever died, nor even slept, but that it
had been repressed and buried under the sad
events through which she had passed.  But now
she was evidently loosening the bonds which had
kept it in check, for it rose again within her, and
threatened once more to flow in upon her in
waves of unrest.  True, she had sometimes met
her old lover on the way to and from chapel, or
market, or fair, but never alone, and always Ivor
had been calm and undemonstrative.
</p>

<p>
"Had he forgotten her?" she wondered.
"Had the years brought him submission and
indifference.  She was still so young&mdash;only
twenty-three.  It was no wonder if that pensive curve
of the lips and that moisture in the brown eyes
betokened a little wistful rebelling against fate.
Why! why should she not be happy?  Why did
Ivor so persistently avoid her?" and so lost was
she in her own thoughts, that she did not hear
a footstep which passed along the path above her.
</p>

<p>
It was Ivor Parry, sauntering up from the
mill with the intention of paying one of his
infrequent visits to Mwntseison.  He had
longed latterly more and more for a sight of
Gwladys, and he chafed under the restraints
which he had placed upon himself, and the
proprieties of village life which kept them
apart.
</p>

<p>
But surely here she was close beside him! every
barrier removed from his path! no moral
restraint to be fought with, as of old! nothing to
prevent their intercourse!  The suddenness and
greatness of the thought took his breath away,
and though, with a man's impetuosity, he never
hesitated to grasp the opportunity, still the strong
man trembled as he approached the unconscious
girl.
</p>

<p>
"Gwladys!" he said at last, and in a moment
she had started to her feet, the rich blood
surging over neck, cheek, and brow.
</p>

<p>
"Ivor!" was all her answer.
</p>

<p>
And then, with the ridiculous combination of
the commonplace and the romantic, their first
embarrassed words were the usual remarks upon
the weather.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis tewi br√¢f!" said Gwladys, who was the
first to recover self-possession.
</p>

<p>
"Br√¢f, indeed!" said Ivor.  "Wilt not sit
down again?"
</p>

<p>
But she hesitated.
</p>

<p>
"Come!" he said, arranging the bundle of
fern; "and will I sit by thy side?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I don't know," said Gwladys, looking
round, as if for inspiration.
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Ivor, laughing at her embarrassment;
"look round at earth, sea, and sky, and see
if thou canst find a reason why I should not sit
on this bank beside thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed, I suppose there isn't one whatever,"
she answered, laughing, and sitting down
on the furze again, while Ivor stretched himself
on the grass beside her.
</p>

<p>
Both felt the enchantment of the hour, and
both endeavoured to relieve the tension by falling
into a commonplace remark.
</p>

<p>
But what was the matter with the sea
to-night? that in every pause of the conversation it
sent up whisperings and murmurings, that bore
in their tones such personal suggestions to both
Ivor and Gwladys!
</p>

<p>
They could distinctly hear the dash of the
waves on Traeth-y-daran, and in both their
hearts arose the memory of the night they had
spent together there.
</p>

<p>
A bright star followed in the wake of the sun,
and though Ivor only said, "'Tis a fair sunset,
and promises another fine day," to which she
smilingly assented, yet in the hearts of both arose
the memory of the star whose setting they had
watched together.
</p>

<p>
Yes, though not a word of love was spoken
between them, for Ivor still feared to startle his
companion by a too sudden change of manner,
still both felt that the barriers were down, that
the cold wall of separation was broken, and that
once more the tide of love was flowing full
towards them.
</p>

<p>
At last, when the evening breeze grew colder,
and warned them they must part, there came
a louder swish from the waves below, and
Gwladys, with drooping eyes, said:
</p>

<p>
"I don't forget what thou didst for me in the
storm down there, Ivor.  I have never thanked
thee, oh, no! but it is all here," and she laid her
hand on her heart.
</p>

<p>
"There is no need, lass.  Between me and
thee there is no need for words, we have gone
through too many bitter things together not to
understand each other now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed!" was all her answer; and,
with great relief, from that hour she put away
from her all that was bitter in the memory of the
past, and began to make room in her soul for the
flowers of hope that were springing up within her.
</p>

<p>
"Well, good-night, lass.  I have had a happy
hour&mdash;and thou?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, yes, I suppose indeed," was all she
answered; but it was accompanied with such a
happy smile that Ivor seemed quite content, and
astonished Acsa by entering the mill yard with
a merry song on his lips.
</p>

<p>
This night's meeting was the prelude to many
more on the cliffs, on the shore, or on the bay,
and when the winter came in real earnest, Ivor's
visits to Mwntseison were of very frequent
occurrence.
</p>

<p>
One evening in the early spring he walked
again in the mill garden, and sought and found
under the furze hedge a bunch of sweet violets,
which he gathered before he took his way up the
side of the hill to meet Gwladys.
</p>

<p>
"Vayolettes! vayolettes!" he thought.  "Mari
Vone was right, the name does suit them."  And
as Gwladys pinned them into her bodice, he was
reminded of the sea-pinks which he had snatched
from the table while 'n'wncwl Jos lay ill in his
bed, and which he still treasured between the
pages of one of the old brown books in the mill
bookcase.
</p>

<p>
He would have told her of the incident had
not a tender regard for Hugh's memory made
him hesitate to speak of anything which should
contrast their present freedom with the restraint
of their former meetings.
</p>

<p>
Backwards and forwards over the velvet turf
at the top of the cliffs they roamed together, the
hours passing by unheeded, until, as they reached
the green mound, now lying bathed in the silver
moonlight, which they had named "Mari's
pillow," Gwladys said:
</p>

<p>
"I must not go further, or my mother will be
bolting the door."
</p>

<p>
"Wilt not come to the brow of the hill, 'tis
only a little further, and I have something to
show thee there."
</p>

<p>
And she made no demur, but continued her
walk to the edge of the hill, which sloped down
to the valley of the Berwen.  The little river
gurgled and whispered in the moonlight, as it ran
below them on its way to the sea.
</p>

<p>
"We can hear the Berwen from here," said
Gwladys; "but what hast to show me, Ivor?"
</p>

<p>
"Only the mill!" said he, pointing across
the valley to where the old mill stood by the
noisy little stream.
</p>

<p>
It was a picture of rural beauty as it stood
there, like a grey sentinel at the opening of the
valley.  Landwards, the cwm gradually closed in,
where the thick woods grew down to the water's
edge; between them the old church, the home of
the white owls, which made the glen their
hunting ground, was dimly visible through the haze,
the mill itself showing clear and sharp, with its
silvered points and dark shadows, its ivy-covered
gables well defined in the moonlight.  There
was a firelight glow in the broad kitchen
window, and the smoke curled up from the grey
stone chimney.
</p>

<p>
"Only the mill!" said Ivor again.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, there's pretty it is in the moonlight! and
there's nice things the river is saying down
there!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, 'tis a pretty home; but lonely, lass&mdash;lonely
for me; wilt not come and brighten it,
Gwladys?  Think how long I have waited; think
how much I have suffered&mdash;and thee, too!  Come,
Gwladys, come to the mill with me!  Come,
f'anwylyd, I have not hurried thee; but every
week has seemed a month lately and every
month a year!  Is there any reason in earth or
heaven why we should not be married now?
Why art so silent, Gwladys?"
</p>

<p>
"Only, Ivor, I am wondering can it be that
there is so much happiness in store for me and
thee?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Ivor, in a loud, determined tone,
"there is love and happiness in store for us, if
thou wilt only give thyself to me.  Come and be
the mistress of the old mill, f'anwylyd; come and
be the queen and idol of my heart, as thou hast
always been!  When will we be married?  To-morrow?"
</p>

<p>
"Caton pawb, Ivor, thou art taking my
breath away."
</p>

<p>
"Next week, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, indeed, it will only be on one condition,"
and she held up her finger playfully.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, listen to her," said Ivor delightedly,
"she's beginning to lay down the law already;
and what conditions does my queen enforce?"
and taking off his hat he made her a sweeping
bow.
</p>

<p>
"Well, 'tis this," said Gwladys; "there must
be no wedding&mdash;I mean&mdash;only thee and me, Ivor."
</p>

<p>
"What! not the parson?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, of course, fwlcyn dwl; but no one else."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed!" said Ivor.
</p>

<p>
"And no one at Mwntseison must know
about it, only mother."
</p>

<p>
"Agreed!" said Ivor again.  "And why
must we have no one at our wedding, fanwylyd?"
</p>

<p>
"There will be two there indeed, I think,"
she said, the merry dimples giving place to a
more serious, though happy smile.
</p>

<p>
Ivor looked at her for a moment inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"Dost mean Hugh and Mari Vone?"
</p>

<p>
She nodded.
</p>

<p>
"'Tis a beautiful thought indeed, lass; and
why not? and thou art right, Gwladys, 'twould
be hard indeed to find fit company for them."
</p>

<p>
And so it was settled between them; and in
the old mill by the Berwen, Ivor and Gwladys
found in the long years to come that happiness,
so long delayed and waited for, is sometimes
found even on earth!
